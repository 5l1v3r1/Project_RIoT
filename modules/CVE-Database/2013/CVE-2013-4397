    An integer overflow error within the &ldquo;th_read()&rdquo; function when       processing long names or link extensions can be exploited to cause a       heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted archive.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file       using a program linked against libtar, possibly resulting in execution of       arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service       condition.

An updated libtar package that fixes one security issue is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section.

The libtar package contains a C library for manipulating tar archives.
The library supports both the strict POSIX tar format and many of the commonly used GNU extensions.
