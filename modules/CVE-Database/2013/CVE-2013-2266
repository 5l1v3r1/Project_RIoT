An environment variable exposed to the user is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
The vulnerable environment variable uses untrusted data.
Tainted data used in the environment variables is not properly validated. For instance boundary checking is not done before copying the input data to a buffer., related_weakness: [120, 302, 118, 119, 74, 99, 20, 680, 733, 697], solutions: Do not expose environment variable to the user.
Do not use untrusted data in your environment variables.
Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking
There are tools such as Sharefuzz [R.10.3] which is an environment variable fuzzer for Unix that support loading a shared library. You can use Sharefuzz to determine if you are exposing an environment variable vulnerable to buffer overflow., summary: This attack pattern involves causing a buffer overflow through manipulation of environment variables. Once the attacker finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers. This attack leverages implicit trust often placed in environment variables.}, {id: 100, name: Overflow Buffers, prerequisites: Targeted software performs buffer operations.
Targeted software inadequately performs bounds-checking on buffer operations.
Attacker has the capability to influence the input to buffer operations., related_weakness: [120, 119, 131, 129, 805, 19, 680], solutions: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow.
If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.
Utilize static source code analysis tools to identify potential buffer overflow weaknesses in the software., summary: Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer operations, typically triggered by input injected by an attacker. As a consequence, an attacker is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the attackers' choice.}, {id: 14, name: Client-side Injection-induced Buffer Overflow, prerequisites: The targeted client software communicates with an external server.
The targeted client software has a buffer overflow vulnerability., related_weakness: [120, 353, 118, 119, 74, 20, 680, 697, 713], solutions: The client software should not install untrusted code from a non-authenticated server.
The client software should have the latest patches and should be audited for vulnerabilities before being used to communicate with potentially hostile servers.
Perform input validation for length of buffer inputs.
Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Ensure all buffer uses are consistently bounds-checked.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution., summary: This type of attack exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in targeted client software through injection of malicious content from a custom-built hostile service.}, {id: 24, name: Filter Failure through Buffer Overflow, prerequisites: Ability to control the length of data passed to an active filter., related_weakness: [120, 119, 118, 74, 20, 680, 733, 697], solutions: Make sure that ANY failure occurring in the filtering or input validation routine is properly handled and that offending input is NOT allowed to go through. Basically make sure that the vault is closed when failure occurs.
Pre-design: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Pre-design through Build: Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Operational: Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.
Design: Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution., summary: In this attack, the idea is to cause an active filter to fail by causing an oversized transaction. An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that the filter does not fail securely (i.e. the user input is let into the system unfiltered).}, {id: 42, name: MIME Conversion, prerequisites: The target system uses a mail server.
Mail server vendor has not released a patch for the MIME conversion routine, the patch itself has a security hole or does not fix the original problem, or the patch has not been applied to the user's system., related_weakness: [120, 119, 74, 20], solutions: Stay up to date with third party vendor patches
From "Exploiting Software", please see reference below.
Use the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh)
Use mail.local, summary: An attacker exploits a weakness in the MIME conversion routine to cause a buffer overflow and gain control over the mail server machine. The MIME system is designed to allow various different information formats to be interpreted and sent via e-mail. Attack points exist when data are converted to MIME compatible format and back.}, {id: 44, name: Overflow Binary Resource File, prerequisites: Target software processes binary resource files.
Target software contains a buffer overflow vulnerability reachable through input from a user-controllable binary resource file., related_weakness: [120, 119, 697, 713], solutions: Perform appropriate bounds checking on all buffers.
Design: Enforce principle of least privilege
Design: Static code analysis
Implementation: Execute program in less trusted process space environment, do not allow lower integrity processes to write to higher integrity processes
Implementation: Keep software patched to ensure that known vulnerabilities are not available for attackers to target on host., summary: An attack of this type exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of binary resources. Binary resources may include music files like MP3, image files like JPEG files, and any other binary file. These attacks may pass unnoticed to the client machine through normal usage of files, such as a browser loading a seemingly innocent JPEG file. This can allow the attacker access to the execution stack and execute arbitrary code in the target process. This attack pattern is a variant of standard buffer overflow attacks using an unexpected vector (binary files) to wrap its attack and open up a new attack vector. The attacker is required to either directly serve the binary content to the victim, or place it in a locale like a MP3 sharing application, for the victim to download. The attacker then is notified upon the download or otherwise locates the vulnerability opened up by the buffer overflow.}, {id: 45, name: Buffer Overflow via Symbolic Links, prerequisites: The attacker can create symbolic link on the target host.
The target host does not perform correct boundary checking while consuming data from a resources., related_weakness: [120, 285, 302, 118, 119, 74, 20, 680, 697], solutions: Pay attention to the fact that the resource you read from can be a replaced by a Symbolic link. You can do a Symlink check before reading the file and decide that this is not a legitimate way of accessing the resource.
Because Symlink can be modified by an attacker, make sure that the ones you read are located in protected directories.
Pay attention to the resource pointed to by your symlink links (See attack pattern named "Forced Symlink race"), they can be replaced by malicious resources.
Always check the size of the input data before copying to a buffer.
Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution., summary: This type of attack leverages the use of symbolic links to cause buffer overflows. An attacker can try to create or manipulate a symbolic link file such that its contents result in out of bounds data. When the target software processes the symbolic link file, it could potentially overflow internal buffers with insufficient bounds checking.}, {id: 46, name: Overflow Variables and Tags, prerequisites: The target program consumes user-controllable data in the form of tags or variables.
The target program does not perform sufficient boundary checking., related_weakness: [120, 118, 119, 74, 20, 680, 733, 697], solutions: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.
Do not trust input data from user. Validate all user input., summary: This type of attack leverages the use of tags or variables from a formatted configuration data to cause buffer overflow. The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page or configuration file that includes oversized strings, thus causing an overflow.}, {id: 47, name: Buffer Overflow via Parameter Expansion, prerequisites: The program expands one of the parameters passed to a function with input controlled by the user, but a later function making use of the expanded parameter erroneously considers the original, not the expanded size of the parameter.
The expanded parameter is used in the context where buffer overflow may become possible due to the incorrect understanding of the parameter size (i.e. thinking that it is smaller than it really is)., related_weakness: [120, 119, 118, 130, 131, 74, 20, 680, 697], solutions: Ensure that when parameter expansion happens in the code that the assumptions used to determine the resulting size of the parameter are accurate and that the new size of the parameter is visible to the whole system, summary: In this attack, the target software is given input that the attacker knows will be modified and expanded in size during processing. This attack relies on the target software failing to anticipate that the expanded data may exceed some internal limit, thereby creating a buffer overflow.}, {id: 8, name: Buffer Overflow in an API Call, prerequisites: The target host exposes an API to the user.
One or more API functions exposed by the target host has a buffer overflow vulnerability., related_weakness: [120, 119, 118, 74, 20, 680, 733, 697], solutions: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow.
If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution., summary: This attack targets libraries or shared code modules which are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. An attacker who has access to an API may try to embed malicious code in the API function call and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function's implementation. All clients that make use of the code library thus become vulnerable by association. This has a very broad effect on security across a system, usually affecting more than one software process.}, {id: 9, name: Buffer Overflow in Local Command-Line Utilities, prerequisites: The target host exposes a command-line utility to the user.
The command-line utility exposed by the target host has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited., related_weakness: [120, 118, 119, 74, 20, 680, 733, 697], solutions: Carefully review the service's implementation before making it available to user. For instance you can use manual or automated code review to uncover vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow.
Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.
Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.
Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.
Operational: Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.
Apply the latest patches to your user exposed services. This may not be a complete solution, especially against a zero day attack.
Do not unnecessarily expose services., summary: This attack targets command-line utilities available in a number of shells. An attacker can leverage a vulnerability found in a command-line utility to escalate privilege to root.}], cvss: 7.8, cvss-time: 2013-11-22T14:58:08.517000, cwe: CWE-119, id: CVE-2013-2266, impact: {availability: COMPLETE, confidentiality: NONE, integrity: NONE}, last-modified: 2018-10-30T12:27:02.577000, nessus: [{NASL family: CentOS Local Security Checks, NASL id: CENTOS_RHSA-2013-0690.NASL, description: Updated bind97 packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Security Fixes Removed the check for regex.h in configure in order to disable regex syntax checking, as it exposes BIND to a critical flaw in libregex on some platforms. [CVE-2013-2266] [RT #32688] https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00871 (bnc#811876) Prevents named from aborting with a require assertion failure on servers with DNS64 enabled. These crashes might occur as a result of specific queries that are received. (Note that this fix is a subset of a series of updates that will be included in full in BIND 9.8.5 and 9.9.3 as change #3388, RT #30996). [CVE-2012-5688] [RT #30792] A deliberately constructed combination of records could cause named to hang while populating the additional section of a response. [CVE-2012-5166] [RT #31090] Prevents a named assert (crash) when queried for a record whose RDATA exceeds 65535 bytes [CVE-2012-4244] [RT #30416] Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using 'Bad cache' data before it has been initialized. [CVE-2012-3817] [RT #30025] A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of the named process. [CVE-2012-1667] [RT #29644] New Features Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm keys and signatures in DNSSEC are now supported per RFC 6605. [RT #21918] Feature Changes Improves OpenSSL error logging [RT #29932] nslookup now returns a nonzero exit code when it is unable to get an answer. [RT #29492] Bug Fixes Uses binary mode to open raw files on Windows. [RT #30944] Static-stub zones now accept 'forward' and 'fowarders' options (often needed for subdomains of the zone referenced to override global forwarding options). These options are already available with traditional stub zones and their omission from zones of type 'static-stub' was an inadvertent oversight. [RT #30482] Limits the TTL of signed RRsets in cache when their RRSIGs are approaching expiry. This prevents the persistence in cache of invalid RRSIGs in order to assist recovery from a situation where zone re-signing doesn't occur in a timely manner. With this change, named will attempt to obtain new RRSIGs from the authoritative server once the original ones have expired, and even if the TTL of the old records would in other circumstances cause them to be kept in cache for longer. [RT #26429] Corrects the syntax of isc_atomic_xadd() and isc_atomic_cmpxchg() which are employed on Itanium systems to speed up lock management by making use of atomic operations. Without the syntax correction it is possible that concurrent access to the same structures could accidentally occur with unpredictable results.
[RT #25181] The configure script now supports and detects libxml2-2.8.x correctly [RT #30440] The host command should no longer assert on some architectures and builds while handling the time values used with the -w (wait forever) option. [RT #18723] Invalid zero settings for max-retry-time, min-retry-time, max-refresh-time, min-refresh-time will now be detected during parsing of named.conf and an error emitted instead of triggering an assertion failure on startup. [RT #27730] Removes spurious newlines from log messages in zone.c [RT #30675] When built with readline support (i.e. on a system with readline installed) nsupdate no longer terminates unexpectedly in interactive mode. [RT #29550] All named tasks that perform task-exclusive operations now share the same single task. Prior to this change, there was the possibility of a race condition between rndc operations and other functions such as re-sizing the adb hash table. If the race condition was encountered, named would in most cases terminate unexpectedly with an assert. [RT #29872] Ensures that servers are expired from the ADB cache when the timeout limit is reached so that their learned attributes can be refreshed. Prior to this change, servers that were frequently queried might never have their entries removed and reinitialized. This is of particular importance to DNSSEC-validating recursive servers that might erroneously set 'no-edns' for an authoritative server following a period of intermittent connectivity. [RT #29856] Adds additional resilience to a previous security change (3218) by preventing RRSIG data from being added to cache when a pseudo-record matching the covering type and proving non-existence exists at a higher trust level. The earlier change prevented this inconsistent data from being retrieved from cache in response to client queries - with this additional change, the RRSIG records are no longer inserted into cache at all. [RT #26809] dnssec-settime will now issue a warning when the writing of a new private key file would cause a change in the permissions of the existing file. [RT #27724] Fixes the defect introduced by change #3314 that was causing failures when saving stub zones to disk (resulting in excessive CPU usage in some cases). [RT #29952] It is now possible to using multiple control keys again - this functionality was inadvertently broken by change #3924 (RT #28265) which addressed a memory leak. [RT #29694] Setting resolver-query-timeout too low could cause named problems recovering after a loss of connectivity. [RT #29623] Reduces the potential build-up of stale RRsets in cache on a busy recursive nameserver by re-using cached DS and RRSIG rrsets when possible [RT #29446] Corrects a failure to authenticate non-existence of resource records in some circumstances when RPZ has been configured. Also :

  - adds an optional 'recursive-only yes|no' to the     response-policy statement

  - adds an optional 'max-policy-ttl' to the response-policy     statement to limit the false data that 'recursive-only     no' can introduce into resolvers' caches

  - introduces a predefined encoding of PASSTHRU policy by     adding 'rpz-passthru' to be used as the target of CNAME     policy records (the old encoding is still accepted.)

  - adds a RPZ performance test to bin/tests/system/rpz when     queryperf is available. [RT #26172]     Upper-case/lower-case handling of RRSIG signer-names is     now handled consistently: RRSIG records are generated     with the signer-name in lower case. They are accepted     with any case, but if they fail to validate, we try     again in lower case. [RT #27451]
