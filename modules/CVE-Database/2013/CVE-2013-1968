Updated subversion packages that fix three security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The mod_dav_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access to Subversion repositories via HTTP.

A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav_svn module handled OPTIONS requests. A remote attacker with read access to an SVN repository served via HTTP could use this flaw to cause the httpd process that handled such a request to crash. (CVE-2014-0032)

A flaw was found in the way Subversion handled file names with newline characters when the FSFS repository format was used. An attacker with commit access to an SVN repository could corrupt a revision by committing a specially crafted file. (CVE-2013-1968)

A flaw was found in the way the svnserve tool of Subversion handled remote client network connections. An attacker with read access to an SVN repository served via svnserve could use this flaw to cause the svnserve daemon to exit, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2013-2112)

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

Several security vulnerabilities are fixed in this update :

Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will trigger an assertion on some requests made against a revision root. This can lead to a DoS. If assertions are disabled it will trigger a read overflow which may cause a segmentation fault or undefined behavior. Commit access is required to exploit this. (CVE-2013-4131)

If a filename which contains a newline character (ASCII 0x0a) is committed to a repository using the FSFS format, the resulting revision is corrupt. This can lead to disruption for users of the repository. (CVE-2013-1968)

Subversion's contrib/ directory contains two example hook scripts, which use 'svnlook changed' to examine a revision or transaction and then pass those paths as arguments to further 'svnlook' commands, without properly escaping the command-line. (CVE-2013-2088)

Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP connection is closed early in the connection process. This can lead to disruption for users of the server. (CVE-2013-2112)
