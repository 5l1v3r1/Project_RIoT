    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and V8. Please       review the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for       details.
  Impact :

    A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially       crafted website or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, possibly       resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the       process or a Denial of Service condition.
