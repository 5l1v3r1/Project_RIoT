Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.

Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources., summary: This attack targets a race condition occurring when multiple processes access and manipulate the same resource concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place. The attacker can leverage a race condition by "running the race", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance a race condition can occur while accessing a file, the attacker can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file.}, {id: 29, name: Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions, prerequisites: A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

The typical example is the file access. The attacker can leverage a file access race condition by "running the race", meaning that he would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the attacker could do something such as replace the file and cause an escalation of privilege.}], cvss: 5.7, cvss-time: 2013-07-16T11:47:00, cwe: CWE-362, id: CVE-2013-1935, impact: {availability: COMPLETE, confidentiality: NONE, integrity: NONE}, last-modified: 2019-04-22T13:48:00.643000, nessus: [{NASL family: Red Hat Local Security Checks, NASL id: REDHAT-RHSA-2013-0911.NASL, description: Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues :

* A flaw was found in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) initialized a guest's registered pv_eoi (paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag when entering the guest. An unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2013-1935, Important)

* A missing sanity check was found in the kvm_set_memory_region() function in KVM, allowing a user-space process to register memory regions pointing to the kernel address space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1943, Important)

* A double free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Virtual Ethernet Tunnel driver (veth). A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash a target system. (CVE-2013-2017, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank IBM for reporting the CVE-2013-1935 issue and Atzm WATANABE of Stratosphere Inc. for reporting the CVE-2013-2017 issue. The CVE-2013-1943 issue was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way KVM initialized a guest's registered pv_eoi (paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag when entering the guest. An unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2013-1935)

A flaw was found in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries were processed. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management server. (CVE-2013-0167)

Red Hat would like to thank IBM for reporting the CVE-2013-1935 issue.
The CVE-2013-0167 issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization team.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers :

CVE-2013-1962 (libvirt issue)

CVE-2013-2017 and CVE-2013-1943 (kernel issues)

CVE-2012-6137 (subscription-manager issue)

This update also contains the fixes from the following errata :

* vdsm: RHSA-2013:0886, which adds support for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.2 clusters.

* ovirt-node: RHBA-2013:0908

Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may appear with the status of 'Install Failed'. If this happens, place the host into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an 'Up' state.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-12-20, plugin id: 78961, published: 2014-11-08, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=78961, title: RHEL 6 : rhev-hypervisor6 (RHSA-2013:0907)}, {NASL family: CentOS Local Security Checks, NASL id: CENTOS_RHSA-2013-0911.NASL, description: Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
