A bug has been discovered in the most recent releases of BIND 9 which has the potential for deliberate exploitation as a denial-of-service attack. By sending a recursive resolver a query for a record in a specially malformed zone, an attacker can cause BIND 9 to exit with a fatal 'RUNTIME_CHECK' error in resolver.c., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-10, plugin id: 66837, published: 2013-06-07, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=66837, title: FreeBSD : dns/bind9* -- A recursive resolver can be crashed by a query for a malformed zone (72f35727-ce83-11e2-be04-005056a37f68)}, {NASL family: DNS, NASL id: BIND9_993_P1.NASL, description: According to its self-reported version number, the remote installation of BIND can be forced to crash via a 'RUNTIME_CHECK' error in 'resolver.c' caused by specially crafted queries for a record in a malformed zone to a recursive resolver.

It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - There are multiple vulnerabilities within the included     BIND, the most serious of which can lead to a denial of     service. (CVE-2013-3919, CVE-2013-4854, CVE-2014-0591)

  - There are multiple vulnerabilities within the included     LibYAML for the Profile Manager and ServerRuby, the most     serious of which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    (CVE-2013-4164, CVE-2013-6393)

  - There are multiple vulnerabilities within the included     PostgreSQL, the most serious of which can lead to     arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2014-0060, CVE-2014-0061,     CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064,     CVE-2014-0065, CVE-2014-0066)

  - An error exists related to the way SSL 3.0 handles     padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using     block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. A     man-in-the-middle attacker can decrypt a selected byte     of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able     to force a victim application to repeatedly send the     same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections. This     is also known as the 'POODLE' issue. (CVE-2014-3566)

  - A cross-site scripting flaw exists in the Xcode Server     due to not properly validating input before returning it     to the user. This can allow a remote attacker, using a     specially crafted request, to execute code within the     browser / server trust relationship. (CVE-2014-4406)

  - A SQL injection flaw exists in the Wiki Server due to     not properly sanitizing user input before using it in     SQL queries. This can allow a remote attacker, using a     specially crafted request, to inject or manipulate SQL     queries, thus allowing the manipulation or disclosure     of arbitrary data. (CVE-2014-4424)

  - A restriction bypass flaw exists in the Mail Server due     to SCAL changes being cached and not enforced until the     service had restarted. This can allow an authenticated     remote attacker to bypass those restrictions.
    (CVE-2014-4446)

  - A password disclosure flaw exists in the Profile Manager     due to passwords being potentially saved to a file when     editing or setting up a profile. This can allow a local     attacker to gain access to password information.
