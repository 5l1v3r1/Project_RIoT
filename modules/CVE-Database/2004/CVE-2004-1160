Secunia Research has reported a vulnerability in multiple browsers, which can be exploited by malicious people to spoof the content of websites.

The problem is that a website can inject content into another site's window if the target name of the window is known. This can e.g. be exploited by a malicious website to spoof the content of a pop-up window opened on a trusted website.

Secunia has constructed a test, which can be used to check if your browser is affected by this issue :

A workaround for Mozilla-based browsers is available., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-12-19, plugin id: 19083, published: 2005-07-13, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=19083, title: FreeBSD : web browsers -- window injection vulnerabilities (b0911985-6e2a-11d9-9557-000a95bc6fae)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11852], refmap: {bid: [11852], misc: [http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_window_injection_vulnerability_test/, http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2004-13/advisory/], secunia: [13402]}, summary: Netscape 7.x to 7.2, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by injecting content from one window into a target window whose name is known but resides in a different domain, as demonstrated using a pop-up window on a trusted web site, aka the "window injection" vulnerability., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:7.0, title: Netscape Navigator 7.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:7.0.2, title: Netscape Navigator 7.0.2}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:7.1, title: Netscape Navigator 7.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:7.2, title: Netscape Navigator 7.2}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:netscape:navigator:7.0, cpe:/a:netscape:navigator:7.0.2, cpe:/a:netscape:navigator:7.1, cpe:/a:netscape:navigator:7.2]}
