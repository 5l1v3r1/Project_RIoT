The wu-ftpd package contains the Washington University FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server daemon. FTP is a method of transferring files between machines.

Glenn Stewart discovered a flaw in wu-ftpd. When configured with 'restricted-gid home', an authorized user could use this flaw to circumvent the configured home directory restriction by using chmod.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0148 to this issue.

Michael Hendrickx found a flaw in the S/Key login handling. On servers using S/Key authentication, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Users of wu-ftpd are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported security patches and is not vulnerable to these issues., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 12475, published: 2004-07-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=12475, title: RHEL 2.1 : wu-ftpd (RHSA-2004:096)}, {NASL family: Debian Local Security Checks, NASL id: DEBIAN_DSA-457.NASL, description: Two vulnerabilities were discovered in wu-ftpd :

  - CAN-2004-0148     Glenn Stewart discovered that users could bypass the     directory access restrictions imposed by the     restricted-gid option by changing the permissions on     their home directory. On a subsequent login, when access     to the user's home directory was denied, wu-ftpd would     fall back to the root directory.

  - CAN-2004-0185

    A buffer overflow existed in wu-ftpd's code which deals     with S/key authentication., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-20, plugin id: 15294, published: 2004-09-29, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=15294, title: Debian DSA-457-1 : wu-ftpd - several vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: FTP, NASL id: WU_FTPD_SKEY_REMOTE_BUFF.NASL, description: This version of WU-FTPD contains a remote overflow if s/key support is enabled. The skey_challenge function fails to perform bounds checking on the name variable resulting in a buffer overflow. With a specially crafted request, an attacker can execute arbitrary code resulting in a loss of integrity and/or availability.

It appears that this vulnerability may be exploited prior to authentication.
It is reported that S/Key support is not enabled by default, though some operating system distributions which ship WU-FTPD may have it enabled.
