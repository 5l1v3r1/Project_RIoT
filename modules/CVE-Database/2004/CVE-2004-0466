OC WebConnect 6.44 and 6.5 (and possibly previous versions) have multiple remote vulnerabilities :

  - A remote attacker can bring about a denial of service by     sending an HTTP GET or POST request with an MS-DOS device     name in it (Windows platforms only). 

  - A read-only directory traversal vulnerability in 'jretest.html'     allows exposure of files formatted in an INI-style format (any     platform)., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-16, plugin id: 17214, published: 2005-02-24, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=17214, title: OpenConnect WebConnect < 6.5.1 Multiple Vulnerabilities}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=110910838600145&w=2, http://www.cirt.dk/advisories/cirt-29-advisory.pdf, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/552561, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-69FVMM, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/19393], refmap: {bugtraq: [20050220 The WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 contains several vulnerabilities], cert-vn: [VU#552561], confirm: [http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-69FVMM], misc: [http://www.cirt.dk/advisories/cirt-29-advisory.pdf], secunia: [14006], xf: [webconnect-device-name-dos(19393)]}, summary: WebConnect 6.5, 6.4.4, and possibly earlier versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang) via a URL containing an MS-DOS device name such as (1) AUX, (2) CON, (3) PRN, (4) COM1, or (5) LPT1., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:openconnect:webconnect:6.4.4, title: cpe:2.3:a:openconnect:webconnect:6.4.4}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:openconnect:webconnect:6.5, title: cpe:2.3:a:openconnect:webconnect:6.5}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:openconnect:webconnect:6.4.4, cpe:/a:openconnect:webconnect:6.5]}
