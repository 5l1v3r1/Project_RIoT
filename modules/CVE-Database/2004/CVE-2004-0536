    The code that generates email reports contains a format string     vulnerability in pipedmailmessage.cpp.
  Impact :

    With a carefully crafted filename on a local filesystem an attacker     could cause execution of arbitrary code with permissions of the user     running tripwire, which could be the root user.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-19, plugin id: 14513, published: 2004-08-30, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=14513, title: GLSA-200406-02 : tripwire: Format string vulnerability}, {NASL family: Mandriva Local Security Checks, NASL id: MANDRAKE_MDKSA-2004-057.NASL, description: Paul Herman discovered a format string vulnerability in tripwire that could allow a local user to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running tripwire (typically root). This vulnerability only exists when tripwire is generating an email report.

Update :

The packages previously released for Mandrakelinux 9.2 would segfault when doing a check due to compilation problems. The updated packages correct the problem., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 14156, published: 2004-07-31, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=14156, title: Mandrake Linux Security Advisory : tripwire (MDKSA-2004:057-1)}, {NASL family: Red Hat Local Security Checks, NASL id: REDHAT-RHSA-2004-244.NASL, description: Updated Tripwire packages that fix a format string security vulnerability are now available.

Tripwire is a system integrity assessment tool.

Paul Herman discovered a format string vulnerability in Tripwire version 2.3.1 and earlier. If Tripwire is configured to send reports via email, a local user could gain privileges by creating a carefully crafted file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0536 to this issue.

Users of Tripwire are advised to upgrade to this erratum package which contains a backported security patch to correct this issue. The erratum package also contains some minor bug fixes., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-27, plugin id: 12505, published: 2004-07-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=12505, title: RHEL 2.1 : tripwire (RHSA-2004:244)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], redhat: {advisories: [{rhsa: {id: RHSA-2004:244}}]}, references: [http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=108627481507249&w=2, http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=108630983009228&w=2, http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200406-02.xml, http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2004-244.html, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10454, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/16309], refmap: {bid: [10454], bugtraq: [20040602 Format String Vulnerability in Tripwire, 20040603 Re: Format String Vulnerability in Tripwire], gentoo: [GLSA-200406-02], xf: [tripwire-fprintf-format-string(16309)]}, summary: Format string vulnerability in Tripwire commercial 4.0.1 and earlier, including 2.4, and open source 2.3.1 and earlier, allows local users to gain privileges via format string specifiers in a file name, which is used in the generation of an email report., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.2.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.2.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.0, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1.2, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1.2}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.0, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.2, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.2}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:tripwire:tripwire:4.1}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.2.1, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.0, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.3.1.2, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.0, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:2.4.2, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:3.0.1, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:4.0.1, cpe:/a:tripwire:tripwire:4.1]}
