Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement
Design: Server side developers should not proxy content via XHR or other means, if a http proxy for remote content is setup on the server side, the client's browser has no way of discerning where the data is originating from.
Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.
Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser
Implementation: Session tokens for specific host
Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.
Implementation: Privileges are constrained, if a script is loaded, ensure system runs in chroot jail or other limited authority mode, summary: An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The attacker leverages this capability to execute scripts to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The attacker must have the ability to inject script into script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the attacker can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts.
With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host.
Of course, these attacks are not solely limited to the server side, client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well. In general all that is required is for there to be sufficient privileges to execute a script, but not protected against writing.}, {id: 474, name: Signature Spoofing by Key Theft, prerequisites: An authoritative or reputable signer is storing their private signature key with insufficient protection., related_weakness: [284, 693, 216], solutions: Ensure all services are patched and up to date, summary: An attacker obtains an authoritative or reputable signer's private signature key by theft and then uses this key to forge signatures from the original signer to mislead a victim into performing actions that benefit the attacker.}], cvss: 5.8, cwe: CWE-284, id: CVE-2017-10171, last-modified: 2017-08-18T13:48:02.007000, nessus: [{NASL family: Misc., NASL id: ORACLE_E-BUSINESS_CPU_JUL_2017.NASL, description: The version of Oracle E-Business installed on the remote host is missing the July 2017 Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU). It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in the     OpenSSL component in s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c     due to improper use of pointer arithmetic for     heap-buffer boundary checks. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     OpenSSL component in the dsa_sign_setup() function in     dsa_ossl.c due to a failure to properly ensure the use     of constant-time operations. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a timing side-channel     attack, to disclose DSA key information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the OpennSSL     component in the DTLS implementation due to a failure to     properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries     associated with unused out-of-order messages. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, by     maintaining multiple crafted DTLS sessions     simultaneously, to exhaust memory. (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the OpenSSL     component in the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure     Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) implementation. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted time-stamp file that is mishandled by the     'openssl ts' command, to cause a denial of service or to     disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL     component in the Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS     implementation due to improper handling of epoch     sequence numbers in records. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via spoofed DTLS records, to     cause legitimate packets to be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the OpenSSL component in     the BN_bn2dec() function in bn_print.c due to improper     validation of user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM     values. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this to crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the OpenSSL     component in the 3DES and Blowfish algorithms due to the     use of weak 64-bit block ciphers by default. A     man-in-the-middle attacker who has sufficient resources     can exploit this vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack,     to detect a collision that leaks the XOR between the     fixed secret and a known plaintext, allowing the     disclosure of the secret text, such as secure HTTPS     cookies, and possibly resulting in the hijacking of an     authenticated session. (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the OpenSSL component in the     tls_decrypt_ticket() function in t1_lib.c due to     improper handling of ticket HMAC digests. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     ticket that is too short, to crash the process,     resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the OpenSSL     component in the MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c     due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting in a     denial of service condition or possibly the execution of     arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the OpenSSL component in the     ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext() function in t1_lib.c due     to improper handling of overly large OCSP Status Request     extensions from clients. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via large OCSP Status Request     extensions, to exhaust memory resources, resulting in a     denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-6304)

  - A flaw exists in the OpenSSL component in the SSL_peek()     function in rec_layer_s3.c due to improper handling of     empty records. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this, by triggering a zero-length record in an     SSL_peek call, to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a     denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-6305)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the OpenSSL     component in the certificate parser that allows an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of     service via crafted certificate operations.

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL     component in the DTLS implementation due to improper     handling of excessively long DTLS messages. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted DTLS message, to exhaust available memory     resources. (CVE-2016-6308)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     OpenSSL component in the read_state_machine() function     in statem.c due to improper handling of messages larger     than 16k. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this, via a specially crafted message, to cause     a use-after-free error, resulting in a denial of service     condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6309)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL     component in x509_vfy.c due to improper handling of     certificate revocation lists (CRLs).
