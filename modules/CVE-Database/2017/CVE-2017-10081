Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement
Design: Server side developers should not proxy content via XHR or other means, if a http proxy for remote content is setup on the server side, the client's browser has no way of discerning where the data is originating from.
Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.
Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser
Implementation: Session tokens for specific host
Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.
Implementation: Privileges are constrained, if a script is loaded, ensure system runs in chroot jail or other limited authority mode, summary: An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The attacker leverages this capability to execute scripts to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The attacker must have the ability to inject script into script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the attacker can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts.
With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host.
Of course, these attacks are not solely limited to the server side, client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well. In general all that is required is for there to be sufficient privileges to execute a script, but not protected against writing.}, {id: 474, name: Signature Spoofing by Key Theft, prerequisites: An authoritative or reputable signer is storing their private signature key with insufficient protection., related_weakness: [284, 693, 216], solutions: Ensure all services are patched and up to date, summary: An attacker obtains an authoritative or reputable signer's private signature key by theft and then uses this key to forge signatures from the original signer to mislead a victim into performing actions that benefit the attacker.}], cvss: 4.3, cwe: CWE-284, id: CVE-2017-10081, last-modified: 2018-01-04T21:31:26.293000, nessus: [{NASL family: SuSE Local Security Checks, NASL id: OPENSUSE-2018-14.NASL, description: This update for java-1_7_0-openjdk fixes the following issues :

Security Fix(es) :

* It was discovered that the DCG implementation in the RMI component of OpenJDK failed to correctly handle references. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application. (CVE-2017-10102)

* Multiple flaws were discovered in the RMI, JAXP, ImageIO, Libraries, AWT, Hotspot, and Security components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

* It was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the Security component of OpenJDK followed LDAP referrals to arbitrary URLs. A specially crafted LDAP referral URL could cause LDAPCertStore to communicate with non-LDAP servers. (CVE-2017-10116)

* It was discovered that the Nashorn JavaScript engine in the Scripting component of OpenJDK could allow scripts to access Java APIs even when access to Java APIs was disabled. An untrusted JavaScript executed by Nashorn could use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions. (CVE-2017-10078)

* It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK could fail to properly enforce restrictions defined for processing of X.509 certificate chains. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make Java accept certificate using one of the disabled algorithms.
(CVE-2017-10198)

* A covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java application generate DSA signatures on demand could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel. (CVE-2017-10115)

* A covert timing channel flaw was found in the PKCS#8 implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker able to make a Java application repeatedly compare PKCS#8 key against an attacker controlled value could possibly use this flaw to determine the key via a timing side channel. (CVE-2017-10135)

* It was discovered that the BasicAttribute and CodeSource classes in OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating object instances from a serialized form. A specially crafted serialized input stream could cause Java to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2017-10108, CVE-2017-10109)

* Multiple flaws were found in the Hotspot and Security components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10081, CVE-2017-10193)

* It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader implementation in the 2D component of OpenJDK would, in certain cases, read all image data even if it was not used later. A specially crafted image could cause a Java application to temporarily use an excessive amount of CPU and memory.

    (CVE-2017-10243)

  - A covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA     implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A     remote attacker able to make a Java application     generate DSA signatures on demand could possibly use     this flaw to extract certain information about the used     key via a timing side channel.

  - It was discovered that the BasicAttribute and     CodeSource classes in OpenJDK did not limit the amount     of memory allocated when creating object instances from     a serialized form. A specially crafted serialized input     stream could cause Java to consume an excessive amount     of memory. (CVE-2017-10108, CVE-2017-10109)

  - A flaw was found in the Hotspot component in OpenJDK.
    An untrusted Java application or applet could use this     flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.

  - It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader     implementation in the 2D component of OpenJDK would, in     certain cases, read all image data even if it was not     used later. A specially crafted image could cause a     Java application to temporarily use an excessive amount     of CPU and memory. (CVE-2017-10053)

* It was discovered that the BasicAttribute and CodeSource classes in OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating object instances from a serialized form. A specially crafted serialized input stream could cause Java to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2017-10108, CVE-2017-10109)

* A flaw was found in the Hotspot component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10081)

* It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader implementation in the 2D component of OpenJDK would, in certain cases, read all image data even if it was not used later. A specially crafted image could cause a Java application to temporarily use an excessive amount of CPU and memory.
