Note that this plugin is not limited to testing for known vulnerabilities in a specific set of web servers. Instead, it attempts a variety of generic directory traversal attacks and considers a product to be vulnerable simply if it finds evidence of the contents of '/etc/passwd' or a Windows 'win.ini' file in the response.
