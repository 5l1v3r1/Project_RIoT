This vulnerability can be exploited by authorized zone transfers and used in a DoS attack. The named daemon will crash if it receives this type of zone transfer from an authorized source address. The crash is not necessarily immediate, but can range from a few seconds to a few minutes from the time of the attack.

This new version of bind also fixes a bug in the handling of the compression pointer tables which can result in the nameserver entering an infinite loop. This bug has been known to occur in the standard processing of SRV records used with Windows 2000 Active Directory.

All Linux-Mandrake users are encouraged to upgrade bind immediately., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-19, plugin id: 61853, published: 2012-09-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=61853, title: Mandrake Linux Security Advisory : bind (MDKSA-2000:067)}], redhat: {advisories: [{rhsa: {id: RHSA-2000:107}}]}, references: [http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/linux/suse/2000-q4/0657.html, http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000338, http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000339, http://frontal2.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2000:067, http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-20.html, http://www.debian.org/security/2000/20001112, http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2000-107.html, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/5814], refmap: {cert: [CA-2000-20], conectiva: [CLSA-2000:338, CLSA-2000:339], debian: [20001112 bind: remote Denial of Service], ibm: [ERS-SVA-E01-2000:005.1], mandrake: [MDKSA-2000:067], suse: [SuSE-SA:2000:45], xf: [bind-srv-dos(5814)]}, summary: named in BIND 8.2 through 8.2.2-P6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending an SRV record to the server, aka the "srv bug.", vulnerable_configuration: [], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: []}
