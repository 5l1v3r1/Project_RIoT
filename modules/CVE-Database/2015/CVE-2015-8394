It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - The Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library     is affected by multiple vulnerabilities related to the     handling of regular expressions, subroutine calls, and     binary files. A remote attacker can exploit these to     cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive information,     or have other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-8383,     CVE-2015-8386, CVE-2015-8387, CVE-2015-8389,     CVE-2015-8390, CVE-2015-8391, CVE-2015-8393,     CVE-2015-8394)

  - A flaw exists in file ext/standard/exec.c in the     escapeshellcmd() and escapeshellarg() functions due to     the program truncating NULL bytes in strings. A remote     attacker can exploit this to bypass restrictions.

  - A flaw exists in file ext/standard/streamsfuncs.c in the     stream_get_meta_data() function due to a failure to     restrict writing user-supplied data to fields not     already set. A remote attacker can exploit this to     falsify the output of the function, resulting in the     insertion of malicious metadata.

  - A type confusion error exists in file ext/wddx/wddx.c in     the php_wddx_pop_element() function when deserializing     WDDX packets. A remote attacker can exploit this to have     an unspecified impact.

  - A flaw exists in file ext/phar/phar_object.c in the     PharFileInfo::getContent() method due to the use of     uninitialized memory causing improper validation of     user-supplied input. A remote attacker can exploit this     to corrupt memory, resulting in a denial of service or     the execution of arbitrary code.

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in file     ext/phar/tar.c in the phar_tar_setupmetadata() function     when parsing metadata from a crafted TAR file. A remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service.

  - An integer overflow condition exists in file     ext/standard/iptc.c in the iptcembed() function due to     improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based buffer     overflow, resulting in a denial of service or the     execution of arbitrary code.

  - An overflow condition exists in file ext/phar/tar.c in     the phar_parse_tarfile() function due to improper     validation of user-supplied input when decompressing     TAR files. A remote attacker can exploit this to cause     a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of     service or the execution of arbitrary code.
