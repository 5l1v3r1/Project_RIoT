An update for krb5 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

Kerberos is a network authentication system, which can improve the security of your network by eliminating the insecure practice of sending passwords over the network in unencrypted form. It allows clients and servers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC).

Security Fix(es) :

* A memory leak flaw was found in the krb5_unparse_name() function of the MIT Kerberos kadmind service. An authenticated attacker could repeatedly send specially crafted requests to the server, which could cause the server to consume large amounts of memory resources, ultimately leading to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
