Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement
Design: Server side developers should not proxy content via XHR or other means, if a http proxy for remote content is setup on the server side, the client's browser has no way of discerning where the data is originating from.
Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.
Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser
Implementation: Session tokens for specific host
Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.
Implementation: Privileges are constrained, if a script is loaded, ensure system runs in chroot jail or other limited authority mode, summary: An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The attacker leverages this capability to execute scripts to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The attacker must have the ability to inject script into script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the attacker can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts.
With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host.
Of course, these attacks are not solely limited to the server side, client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well. In general all that is required is for there to be sufficient privileges to execute a script, but not protected against writing.}, {id: 474, name: Signature Spoofing by Key Theft, prerequisites: An authoritative or reputable signer is storing their private signature key with insufficient protection., related_weakness: [284, 693, 216], solutions: Ensure all services are patched and up to date, summary: An attacker obtains an authoritative or reputable signer's private signature key by theft and then uses this key to forge signatures from the original signer to mislead a victim into performing actions that benefit the attacker.}], cvss: 7.7, cvss-time: 2016-08-19T16:07:12.487000, cwe: CWE-284, exploit-db: [{description: NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D Driver Service 7.17.13.5382 - Arbitrary Run Key Creation.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the     Stereoscopic 3D Driver Service due to improper     restriction of access to the 'stereosvrpipe' named pipe.
    An adjacent attacker can exploit this to execute     arbitrary command line arguments, resulting in an     escalation of privileges. (CVE-2015-7865)

  - A privilege escalation vulnerability exists due to an     unquoted Windows search path issue in the Smart Maximize     Helper (nvSmartMaxApp.exe). A local attacker can exploit     this to escalate privileges. (CVE-2015-7866)

  - Multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities exist in     the NVAPI support layer due to multiple unspecified     integer overflow conditions in the underlying kernel     mode driver. A local attacker can exploit these issues     to gain access to uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory,     resulting in an escalation of privileges.
