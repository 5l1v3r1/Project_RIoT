  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK     (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to     the support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys     less than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle     attacker may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection     to use EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in     a short amount of time, allowing the attacker to     intercept and decrypt the traffic.

  - Multiple, unspecified errors exist that allow remote     attackers to cause a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2015-1231)

  - An out-of-bounds write flaw exists due to an array index     error in the DispatchSendMidiData() function that occurs     when handling a port index supplied by a renderer. A     remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of     service condition. (CVE-2015-1232)

  - A spoofing vulnerability exists due to improper     interaction between the '1993 search' features and     restore-from-disk RELOAD transitions when Instant     Extended mode is used. A remote attacker can exploit     this to spoof the address bar for a search-results page.
