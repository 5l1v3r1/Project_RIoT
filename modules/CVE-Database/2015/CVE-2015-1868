These security issues were fixed :

  - CVE-2015-1868: The label decompression functionality in     PowerDNS Recursor 3.5.x, 3.6.x before 3.6.3, and 3.7.x     before 3.7.2 and Authoritative (Auth) Server 3.2.x,     3.3.x before 3.3.2, and 3.4.x before 3.4.4 allowed     remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU     consumption or crash) via a request with a name that     refers to itself (bsc#927569).

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via specially crafted query packets, to crash the server.
