The overflow is caused by by issuing the 'HELO' command, followed by a long argument.

The HELO command is typically one of the first commands required by a mail server. The command is used by the mail server as a first attempt to allow the client to identify itself. As such, this command occurs before there is any authentication or validation of mailboxes, etc.

This issue may allow an attacker to crash the mail server, or possibly execute arbitrary code., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 10324, published: 1999-11-10, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=10324, title: XtraMail SMTP HELO Command Remote Overflow}, {NASL family: Gain a shell remotely, NASL id: XTRAMAIL_POP_OVERFLOW.NASL, description: The remote POP3 server is vulnerable to the following buffer overflow :
