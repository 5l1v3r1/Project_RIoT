Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass e-mail scanning via a filename in the Content-Type field with an excluded extension such as .nch or .dbx, but a malicious extension in the Content-Disposition field, which is used by Outlook to obtain the file name.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but Norton AntiVirus or the Office plug-in would detect the virus before it is executed., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_antivirus:2002, title: cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_antivirus:2002}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:symantec:norton_antivirus:2002]}
