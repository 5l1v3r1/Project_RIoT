To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a malformed applet to a user on this host, and have him execute it. The malicious applet would then be able to execute code outside the sandbox of the VM., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 11177, published: 2002-11-28, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=11177, title: MS02-052: Flaw in Microsoft VM Could Allow Code Execution (810030)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=103682630823080&w=2, http://marc.info/?l=ntbugtraq&m=103684360031565&w=2, http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/10588.php, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6136, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2002/ms02-069], refmap: {bid: [6136], bugtraq: [20021108 Technical information about unpatched MS Java vulnerabilities], ms: [MS02-069], ntbugtraq: [20021108 Technical information about unpatched MS Java vulnerabilities], xf: [msvm-html-applet-dos(10588)]}, summary: The Microsoft Java implementation, as used in Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly conduct other unauthorized activities via applet tags in HTML that bypass Java class restrictions (such as private constructors) by providing the class name in the code parameter, aka "Incomplete Java Object Instantiation Vulnerability.", vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:java_virtual_machine:1.1, title: Microsoft JVM 1.1}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:microsoft:java_virtual_machine:1.1]}
