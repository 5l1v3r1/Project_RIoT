X-News uses a flat-file database to store information.  It will run on most Unix and Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems. 

X-News stores user ids and passwords, as MD5 hashes, in a world- readable file, 'db/users.txt'.  This is the same information that is issued by X-News in cookie-based authentication credentials.  An attacker may incorporate this information into cookies and then submit them to gain unauthorized access to the X-News administrative account., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-08-22, plugin id: 12068, published: 2004-02-21, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=12068, title: X-News Password MD5 Hash Authentication Bypass}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://securitytracker.com/id?1003828, http://www.ifrance.com/kitetoua/tuto/x_holes.txt, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/162723, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4283, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/8465], refmap: {bid: [4283], cert-vn: [VU#162723], misc: [http://www.ifrance.com/kitetoua/tuto/x_holes.txt], sectrack: [1003828], xf: [xnews-users-world-readable(8465)]}, summary: X-News (x_news) 1.1 and earlier allows attackers to authenticate as other users by obtaining the MD5 checksum of the password, e.g. via sniffing or the users.txt data file, and providing it in a cookie., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:xqus:x-news:1.0, title: cpe:2.3:a:xqus:x-news:1.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:xqus:x-news:1.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:xqus:x-news:1.1}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:xqus:x-news:1.0, cpe:/a:xqus:x-news:1.1]}
