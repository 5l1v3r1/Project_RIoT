By tricking an user into processing a specially crafted TIF file with tiff2pdf, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (CVE-2006-2193)

A. Alejandro Hernandez discovered a buffer overflow in the tiffsplit utility. By calling tiffsplit with specially crafted long arguments, an user can execute arbitrary code. If tiffsplit is used in e. g. a web-based frontend or similar automated system, this could lead to remote arbitary code execution with the privileges of that system. (In normal interactive command line usage this is not a vulnerability.) (CVE-2006-2656).
