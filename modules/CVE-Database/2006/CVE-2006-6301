    Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that     DenyHosts used an incomplete regular expression to parse failed login     attempts.
  Impact :

    A remote unauthenticated attacker can add arbitrary hosts to the     blacklist by attempting to login with a specially crafted username. An     attacker may use this to prevent legitimate users from accessing a host     remotely.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-08-10, plugin id: 23990, published: 2007-01-08, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=23990, title: GLSA-200701-01 : DenyHosts: Denial of Service}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157163, http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200701-01.xml, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21468, http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/4876, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/30761], refmap: {bid: [21468], confirm: [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157163], gentoo: [GLSA-200701-01], secunia: [23236, 23603], vupen: [ADV-2006-4876], xf: [denyhosts-log-files-dos(30761)]}, summary: DenyHosts 2.5 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a login name containing certain strings with an IP address, which is not properly handled by a regular expression., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:denyhosts:denyhosts:2.5, title: cpe:2.3:a:denyhosts:denyhosts:2.5}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:denyhosts:denyhosts:2.5]}
