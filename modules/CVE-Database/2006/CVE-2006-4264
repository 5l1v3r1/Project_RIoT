NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the $mosConfig_absolute_path variable is only used within a function definition.  CVE source code analysis on 20060824 is not conclusive but tends to concur with the dispute.  In addition, it appears that the component name is actually "lmtg_myhomepage"., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component, title: cpe:2.3:a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component]}
