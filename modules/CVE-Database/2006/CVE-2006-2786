This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team. 

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client. 

Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains Thunderbird version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues. 


From Red Hat Security Advisory 2006:0735 :

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed Javascript code.  A malicious HTML mail message could cause the execution of Javascript code in such a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders HTML mail messages.  A malicious HTML mail message could cause the mail client to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird verifies RSA signatures.  For RSA keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Thunderbird as shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3.  An attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which would be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim.  This flaw was previously thought to be fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)


From Red Hat Security Advisory 2006:0677 :

Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain regular expressions.  A malicious HTML email could cause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-4565, CVE-2006-4566)

A flaw was found in the Thunderbird auto-update verification system.  An attacker who has the ability to spoof a victim's DNS could get Firefox to download and install malicious code.  In order to exploit this issue an attacker would also need to get a victim to previously accept an unverifiable certificate.  (CVE-2006-4567)

A flaw was found in the handling of Javascript timed events.  A malicious HTML email could crash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-4253)

Daniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error in RSA signature verification.  For RSA keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that which would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library.  (CVE-2006-4340)

A flaw was found in Thunderbird that triggered when a HTML message contained a remote image pointing to a XBL script.  An attacker could have created a carefully crafted message which would execute Javascript if certain actions were performed on the email by the recipient, even if Javascript was disabled.  (CVE-2006-4570)

A number of flaws were found in Thunderbird.  A malicious HTML email could cause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-4571)


From Red Hat Bug Fix Advisory 2006:0624 :

A problem was found in Thunderbird where starting the application from a graphical launcher (such as a menu item) did not work. 


From Red Hat Security Advisory 2006:0611 :

The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0 branch.  This update deprecates the Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0 branch in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in favor of the supported Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5 branch. 

This update also resolves a number of outstanding Thunderbird security issues :

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain javascript actions.  A malicious mail message could execute arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of 'chrome', allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776, CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809)

Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain mail messages.  A malicious web page could crash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113, CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain javascript actions.  A malicious mail message could conduct a cross-site scripting attack or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).  (CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

A form file upload flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled javascript input object mutation.  A malicious mail message could upload an arbitrary local file at form submission time without user interaction.  (CVE-2006-2782)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Thunderbird called the crypto.signText() javascript function.  A malicious mail message could crash the browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts.  A malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of 'chrome', allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install client malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

Note: Please note that JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird.  The above issues are not exploitable with JavaScript disabled. 

Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed inline vcard attachments.  If a victim viewed an email message containing a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

A cross site scripting flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 mail messages.  A malicious web page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer could miss due to a malformed 'script' tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain invalid HTTP response headers.  A malicious web site could return specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy restrictions.  (CVE-2006-2786)

A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was called.  If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible to crash Thunderbird.

For reference, these are the details of the original USN :

Jonas Sicking discovered that under some circumstances persisted XUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL. A malicious website could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-35, CVE-2006-2775)

Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an object prototype were getting called by privileged UI code.
It was demonstrated that this could be exploited to run arbitrary web script with full user privileges (MFSA 2006-37, CVE-2006-2776). A similar attack was discovered by moz_bug_r_a4 that leveraged SelectionObject notifications that were called in privileged context. (MFSA 2006-43, CVE-2006-2777)

Mikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText() function. By tricking a user to visit a site with an SSL certificate with specially crafted optional Certificate Authority name arguments, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-38, CVE-2006-2778)

The Mozilla developer team discovered several bugs that lead to crashes with memory corruption. These might be exploitable by malicious websites to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-32, CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-2788)

Chuck McAuley reported that the fix for CVE-2006-1729 (file stealing by changing input type) was not sufficient to prevent all variants of exploitation. (MFSA 2006-41, CVE-2006-2782)

Masatoshi Kimura found a way to bypass web input sanitizers which filter out JavaScript. By inserting 'Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)' characters into the HTML code (e. g.
'<scr[BOM]ipt>'), these filters might not recognize the tags anymore; however, Firefox would still execute them since BOM markers are filtered out before processing the page. (MFSA 2006-42, CVE-2006-2783)

Paul Nickerson noticed that the fix for CVE-2005-0752 (JavaScript privilege escalation on the plugins page) was not sufficient to prevent all variants of exploitation.
(MFSA 2006-36, CVE-2006-2784)

Paul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a user to right-click on a broken image and choose 'View Image' from the context menu then he could get JavaScript to run on a site of the attacker's choosing. This could be used to steal login cookies or other confidential information from the target site. (MFSA 2006-34, CVE-2006-2785)

Kazuho Oku discovered various ways to perform HTTP response smuggling when used with certain proxy servers. Due to different interpretation of nonstandard HTTP headers in Firefox and the proxy server, a malicious website can exploit this to send back two responses to one request. The second response could be used to steal login cookies or other sensitive data from another opened website. (MFSA 2006-33, CVE-2006-2786).

(MFSA 2006-42, CVE-2006-2783)

Paul Nickerson noticed that the fix for CVE-2005-0752 (JavaScript privilege escalation on the plugins page) was not sufficient to prevent all variants of exploitation. (MFSA 2006-36, CVE-2006-2784)

Paul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a user to right-click on a broken image and choose 'View Image' from the context menu then he could get JavaScript to run on a site of the attacker's choosing. This could be used to steal login cookies or other confidential information from the target site. (MFSA 2006-34, CVE-2006-2785)

Kazuho Oku discovered various ways to perform HTTP response smuggling when used with certain proxy servers. Due to different interpretation of nonstandard HTTP headers in Firefox and the proxy server, a malicious website can exploit this to send back two responses to one request. The second response could be used to steal login cookies or other sensitive data from another opened website. (MFSA 2006-33, CVE-2006-2786).

This update provides the corresponding fixes for Ubuntu 5.04 and Ubuntu 5.10.

For reference, these are the details of the original USN :

Jonas Sicking discovered that under some circumstances persisted XUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL. A malicious website could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-35, CVE-2006-2775)

Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an object prototype were getting called by privileged UI code.
It was demonstrated that this could be exploited to run arbitrary web script with full user privileges (MFSA 2006-37, CVE-2006-2776).

Mikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText() function. By sending an email with malicious JavaScript to an user, and that user enabled JavaScript in Thunderbird (which is not the default and not recommended), this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-38, CVE-2006-2778)

The Mozilla developer team discovered several bugs that lead to crashes with memory corruption. These might be exploitable by malicious websites to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-32, CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780)

Masatoshi Kimura discovered a memory corruption (double-free) when processing a large VCard with invalid base64 characters in it. By sending a maliciously crafted set of VCards to a user, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-40, CVE-2006-2781)

Masatoshi Kimura found a way to bypass web input sanitizers which filter out JavaScript. By inserting 'Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)' characters into the HTML code (e. g.
'<scr[BOM]ipt>'), these filters might not recognize the tags anymore; however, Thunderbird would still execute them since BOM markers are filtered out before processing a mail containing JavaScript. (MFSA 2006-42, CVE-2006-2783)

Kazuho Oku discovered various ways to perform HTTP response smuggling when used with certain proxy servers. Due to different interpretation of nonstandard HTTP headers in Thunderbird and the proxy server, a malicious HTML email can exploit this to send back two responses to one request. The second response could be used to steal login cookies or other sensitive data from another opened web site. (MFSA 2006-33, CVE-2006-2786)

It was discovered that JavaScript run via EvalInSandbox() can escape the sandbox. Malicious scripts received in emails containing JavaScript could use these privileges to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-31, CVE-2006-2787).

Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an object prototype were getting called by privileged UI code. It was demonstrated that this could be exploited to run arbitrary web script with full user privileges (MFSA 2006-37, CVE-2006-2776). A similar attack was discovered by moz_bug_r_a4 that leveraged SelectionObject notifications that were called in privileged context. (MFSA 2006-43, CVE-2006-2777)

Mikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText() function. By tricking a user to visit a site with an SSL certificate with specially crafted optional Certificate Authority name arguments, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-38, CVE-2006-2778)

The Mozilla developer team discovered several bugs that lead to crashes with memory corruption. These might be exploitable by malicious websites to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (MFSA 2006-32, CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780)

By sending a maliciously crafted set of VCards to a user, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. (MFSA 2006-40, CVE-2006-2781)

Chuck McAuley reported that the fix for CVE-2006-1729 (file stealing by changing input type) was not sufficient to prevent all variants of exploitation. (MFSA 2006-41, CVE-2006-2782)

Masatoshi Kimura found a way to bypass web input sanitizers which filter out JavaScript. By inserting 'Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)' characters into the HTML code (e. g. '<scr[BOM]ipt>'), these filters might not recognize the tags anymore; however, Mozilla would still execute them since BOM markers are filtered out before processing the page. (MFSA 2006-42, CVE-2006-2783)

Paul Nickerson noticed that the fix for CVE-2005-0752 (JavaScript privilege escalation on the plugins page) was not sufficient to prevent all variants of exploitation. (MFSA 2006-36, CVE-2006-2784)

Paul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a user to right-click on a broken image and choose 'View Image' from the context menu then he could get JavaScript to run on a site of the attacker's choosing. This could be used to steal login cookies or other confidential information from the target site. (MFSA 2006-34, CVE-2006-2785)

Kazuho Oku discovered various ways to perform HTTP response smuggling when used with certain proxy servers. Due to different interpretation of nonstandard HTTP headers in Mozilla and the proxy server, a malicious website can exploit this to send back two responses to one request. The second response could be used to steal login cookies or other sensitive data from another opened website. (MFSA 2006-33, CVE-2006-2786).
