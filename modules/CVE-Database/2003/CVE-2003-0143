The sample exploit requires a valid user account and password, and overflows a string in the pop_msg() function to give the user 'mail' group privileges and a shell on the system. Since the Qvsnprintf function is used elsewhere in qpopper, additional exploits may be possible.

The qpopper package in Debian 2.2 (potato) does not include the vulnerable snprintf implementation. For Debian 3.0 (woody) an updated package is available in version 4.0.4-2.woody.3. Users running an unreleased version of Debian should upgrade to 4.0.4-9 or newer. We recommend you upgrade your qpopper package immediately., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-08-09, plugin id: 15096, published: 2004-09-29, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=15096, title: Debian DSA-259-1 : qpopper - mail user privilege escalation}, {NASL family: SuSE Local Security Checks, NASL id: SUSE_SA_2003_018.NASL, description: The remote host is missing the patch for the advisory SUSE-SA:2003:018 (qpopper).


The Post-Office-Protocol- (POP-) Server qpopper (version 4) was vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow occurs after authentication has taken place. Therefore pop-users with a valid account can execute arbitrary code on the system running qpopper.
Depending on the setup, the malicious code is run with higher privileges.

There is no temporary fix known, please update your system.

Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
Then, install the package using the command 'rpm -Fhv file.rpm' to apply the update., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2016-12-27, plugin id: 13788, published: 2004-07-25, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=13788, title: SUSE-SA:2003:018: qpopper}, {NASL family: Misc., NASL id: QPOPPER_QVSNPRINF_OVERFLOW.NASL, description: The remote Qpopper server, according to its banner, is vulnerable to a one-byte overflow ih its pop_msg function after a call to Qvsnprintf(). 

An attacker may use this flaw to execute code with the privileges of the Qpopper service (usually non-root), provided that he has a valid POP account to log in with.
