This could lead to a denial of service if the client only crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary code under the user id of the chatting user., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-20, plugin id: 15143, published: 2004-09-29, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=15143, title: Debian DSA-306-1 : ircii-pana - buffer overflows, integer overflow}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000655, http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104766521328322&w=2, http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104852615211913&w=2, http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/i/ircii-pana/ircii-pana_1.0-0c16-2.1.diff.gz, http://www.debian.org/security/2003/dsa-306, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7096, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7097, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7099, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7100], refmap: {bid: [7096, 7097, 7099, 7100], bugtraq: [20030313 Buffer overflows in ircII-based clients, 20030324 GLSA:  bitchx (200303-21)], conectiva: [CLA-2003:655], debian: [DSA-306], misc: [http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/i/ircii-pana/ircii-pana_1.0-0c16-2.1.diff.gz]}, summary: Multiple buffer overflows in BitchX IRC client 1.0-0c19 and earlier allow remote malicious IRC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via long hostnames, nicknames, or channel names, which are not properly handled by the functions (1) send_ctcp, (2) cannot_join_channel, (3) cluster, (4) BX_compress_modes, (5) handle_oper_vision, and (6) ban_it., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:colten_edwards:bitchx:1.0.0c19, title: cpe:2.3:a:colten_edwards:bitchx:1.0.0c19}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:colten_edwards:bitchx:1.0.0c19]}
