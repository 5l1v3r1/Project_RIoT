The overflow appears when slocate is used with the -c and -r parameters, using a 1024 (or 10240) byte string. This has been corrected in slocate version 2.7., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-19, plugin id: 14000, published: 2004-07-31, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=14000, title: Mandrake Linux Security Advisory : slocate (MDKSA-2003:015)}, {NASL family: Red Hat Local Security Checks, NASL id: REDHAT-RHSA-2004-041.NASL, description: Updated slocate packages are now available that fix vulnerabilities allowing a local user to gain 'slocate' group privileges.

Slocate is a security-enhanced version of locate, designed to find files on a system via a central database.

Patrik Hornik discovered a vulnerability in Slocate versions up to and including 2.7 where a carefully crafted database could overflow a heap-based buffer. A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain 'slocate' group privileges and then read the entire slocate database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2003-0848 to this issue.

Users of Slocate should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain Slocate version 2.7 with the addition of a patch from Kevin Lindsay that causes slocate to drop privileges before reading a user-supplied database.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 these packages also fix a buffer overflow that affected unpatched versions of Slocate prior to 2.7.
This vulnerability could also allow a local user to gain 'slocate' group privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2003-0056 to this issue., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 12457, published: 2004-07-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=12457, title: RHEL 2.1 / 3 : slocate (RHSA-2004:041)}, {NASL family: Debian Local Security Checks, NASL id: DEBIAN_DSA-252.NASL, description: A problem has been discovered in slocate, a secure locate replacement.
