Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement
Design: Server side developers should not proxy content via XHR or other means, if a http proxy for remote content is setup on the server side, the client's browser has no way of discerning where the data is originating from.
Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.
Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.
Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser
Implementation: Session tokens for specific host
Implementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.
Implementation: Privileges are constrained, if a script is loaded, ensure system runs in chroot jail or other limited authority mode, summary: An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The attacker leverages this capability to execute scripts to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The attacker must have the ability to inject script into script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the attacker can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts.
With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host.
Of course, these attacks are not solely limited to the server side, client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well. In general all that is required is for there to be sufficient privileges to execute a script, but not protected against writing.}, {id: 474, name: Signature Spoofing by Key Theft, prerequisites: An authoritative or reputable signer is storing their private signature key with insufficient protection., related_weakness: [284, 693, 216], solutions: Ensure all services are patched and up to date, summary: An attacker obtains an authoritative or reputable signer's private signature key by theft and then uses this key to forge signatures from the original signer to mislead a victim into performing actions that benefit the attacker.}], cvss: 5.4, cvss-time: 2016-12-06T12:21:02.767000, cwe: CWE-284, id: CVE-2014-8680, impact: {availability: COMPLETE, confidentiality: NONE, integrity: NONE}, nessus: [{NASL family: DNS, NASL id: BIND9_9101_P1.NASL, description: According to its self-reported version number, the remote installation of BIND is affected by multiple denial of service vulnerabilities :

We have today posted updated versions of 9.9.6 and 9.10.1 to address a significant security vulnerability in DNS resolution. The flaw was discovered by Florian Maury of ANSSI, and applies to any recursive resolver that does not support a limit on the number of recursions.
[CERTFR-2014-AVI-512], [USCERT VU#264212]

A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put named into an infinite loop, in which each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups of more name servers. This has been addressed by placing limits on the number of levels of recursion named will allow (default 7), and on the number of queries that it will send before terminating a recursive query (default 50). The recursion depth limit is configured via the max-recursion-depth option, and the query limit via the max-recursion-queries option. For more information, see the security advisory at https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01216/.
[CVE-2014-8500] [RT #37580]

In addition, we have also corrected a potential security vulnerability in the GeoIP feature in the 9.10.1 release only.

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in BIND. Please review the       CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition by the lack of       GeoIP databases, or via a large or infinite number of referrals.

  - An error exists related to handling the     'geoip-directory' option in named.conf when running     'rndc reconfig' or 'rndc reload' that allows connections     by unintended clients.
