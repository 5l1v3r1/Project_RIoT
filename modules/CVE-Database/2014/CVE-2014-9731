Following security bugs were fixed :

  - CVE-2016-0728: A reference leak in keyring handling with     join_session_keyring() could lead to local attackers     gain root privileges. (bsc#962075).

  - CVE-2015-7550: A local user could have triggered a race     between read and revoke in keyctl (bnc#958951).

  - CVE-2015-8569: The (1) pptp_bind and (2) pptp_connect     functions in drivers/net/ppp/pptp.c in the Linux kernel     did not verify an address length, which allowed local     users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory     and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted     application (bnc#959190).

  - CVE-2015-8543: The networking implementation in the     Linux kernel did not validate protocol identifiers for     certain protocol families, which allowed local users to     cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer     dereference and system crash) or possibly gain     privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to     execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application (bnc#958886).

  - CVE-2014-8989: The Linux kernel did not properly     restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships in     certain namespace scenarios, which allowed local users     to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a     POSIX ACL containing an entry for the group category     that is more restrictive than the entry for the other     category, aka a 'negative groups' issue, related to     kernel/groups.c, kernel/uid16.c, and     kernel/user_namespace.c (bnc#906545).

  - CVE-2015-5157: arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux     kernel on the x86_64 platform mishandles IRET faults in     processing NMIs that occurred during userspace     execution, which might allow local users to gain     privileges by triggering an NMI (bnc#937969).

  - CVE-2015-7799: The slhc_init function in     drivers/net/slip/slhc.c in the Linux kernel through     4.2.3 did not ensure that certain slot numbers are     valid, which allowed local users to cause a denial of     service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via     a crafted PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl call (bnc#949936).

  - CVE-2015-8104: The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel     through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x through 4.6.x, allowed     guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS     panic or hang) by triggering many #DB (aka Debug)     exceptions, related to svm.c (bnc#954404).

  - CVE-2015-5307: The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel     through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x through 4.6.x, allowed     guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS     panic or hang) by triggering many #AC (aka Alignment     Check) exceptions, related to svm.c and vmx.c     (bnc#953527).

  - CVE-2014-9529: Race condition in the key_gc_unused_keys     function in security/keys/gc.c in the Linux kernel     allowed local users to cause a denial of service (memory     corruption or panic) or possibly have unspecified other     impact via keyctl commands that trigger access to a key     structure member during garbage collection of a key     (bnc#912202).

  - CVE-2015-7990: Race condition in the rds_sendmsg     function in net/rds/sendmsg.c in the Linux kernel     allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL     pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have     unspecified other impact by using a socket that was not     properly bound. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because     of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-6937 (bnc#952384     953052).

  - CVE-2015-6937: The __rds_conn_create function in     net/rds/connection.c in the Linux kernel allowed local     users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer     dereference and system crash) or possibly have     unspecified other impact by using a socket that was not     properly bound (bnc#945825).

  - CVE-2015-7885: The dgnc_mgmt_ioctl function in     drivers/staging/dgnc/dgnc_mgmt.c in the Linux kernel     through 4.3.3 did not initialize a certain structure     member, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive     information from kernel memory via a crafted application     (bnc#951627).

  - CVE-2015-8215: net/ipv6/addrconf.c in the IPv6 stack in     the Linux kernel did not validate attempted changes to     the MTU value, which allowed context-dependent attackers     to cause a denial of service (packet loss) via a value     that is (1) smaller than the minimum compliant value or     (2) larger than the MTU of an interface, as demonstrated     by a Router Advertisement (RA) message that is not     validated by a daemon, a different vulnerability than     CVE-2015-0272. NOTE: the scope of CVE-2015-0272 is     limited to the NetworkManager product (bnc#955354).

  - CVE-2015-8767: A case can occur when sctp_accept() is     called by the user during a heartbeat timeout event     after the 4-way handshake. Since sctp_assoc_migrate()     changes both assoc->base.sk and assoc->ep, the     bh_sock_lock in sctp_generate_heartbeat_event() will be     taken with the listening socket but released with the     new association socket. The result is a deadlock on any     future attempts to take the listening socket lock.
    (bsc#961509)

  - CVE-2015-8575: Validate socket address length in     sco_sock_bind() to prevent information leak     (bsc#959399).

  - CVE-2015-8551, CVE-2015-8552: xen/pciback: For     XEN_PCI_OP_disable_msi[|x] only disable if device has     MSI(X) enabled (bsc#957990).

  - CVE-2015-8550: Compiler optimizations in the XEN PV     backend drivers could have lead to double fetch     vulnerabilities, causing denial of service or arbitrary     code execution (depending on the configuration)     (bsc#957988).

  - CVE-2015-1420: Race condition in the handle_to_path     function in fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel allowed     local users to bypass intended size restrictions and     trigger read operations on additional memory locations     by changing the handle_bytes value of a file handle     during the execution of this function (bnc#915517).

  - CVE-2015-4692: The kvm_apic_has_events function in     arch/x86/kvm/lapic.h in the Linux kernel allowed local     users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer     dereference and system crash) or possibly have     unspecified other impact by leveraging /dev/kvm access     for an ioctl call (bnc#935542).

  - CVE-2015-4167 CVE-2014-9728 CVE-2014-9730 CVE-2014-9729     CVE-2014-9731: Various problems in the UDF filesystem     were fixed that could lead to crashes when mounting     prepared udf filesystems.

  - CVE-2015-4002: drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the     OZWPAN driver in the Linux kernel did not ensure that     certain length values are sufficiently large, which     allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service     (system crash or large loop) or possibly execute     arbitrary code via a crafted packet, related to the (1)     oz_usb_rx and (2) oz_usb_handle_ep_data functions     (bnc#933934).

  - CVE-2015-4003: The oz_usb_handle_ep_data function in     drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver     in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a     denial of service (divide-by-zero error and system     crash) via a crafted packet (bnc#933934).

  - CVE-2015-4001: Integer signedness error in the     oz_hcd_get_desc_cnf function in     drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozhcd.c in the OZWPAN driver in     the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a     denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute     arbitrary code via a crafted packet (bnc#933934).

  - CVE-2015-4036: A potential memory corruption in     vhost/scsi was fixed.

  - CVE-2015-2922: The ndisc_router_discovery function in     net/ipv6/ndisc.c in the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol     implementation in the IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel     allowed remote attackers to reconfigure a hop-limit     setting via a small hop_limit value in a Router     Advertisement (RA) message (bnc#922583).

  - CVE-2015-3636: It was found that the Linux kernels ping     socket implementation did not properly handle socket     unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could lead     to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture     systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could     use this flaw to crash the system. On non-x86-64     architecture systems, a local user able to create ping     sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges     on the system.

  - CVE-2015-2041: net/llc/sysctl_net_llc.c in the Linux     kernel used an incorrect data type in a sysctl table,     which allowed local users to obtain potentially     sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly     have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl     entry (bnc#919007).

  - CVE-2015-3339: Race condition in the prepare_binprm     function in fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel allowed local     users to gain privileges by executing a setuid program     at a time instant when a chown to root is in progress,     and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not     yet stripped.

  - CVE-2015-1465: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux     kernel did not properly consider the length of the     Read-Copy Update (RCU) grace period for redirecting     lookups in the absence of caching, which allowed remote     attackers to cause a denial of service (memory     consumption or system crash) via a flood of packets     (bnc#916225).

This update corrects the defective patches applied in that update causing these problems. For reference the original advisory text follows.

This update fixes the CVEs described below.

CVE-2011-5321

Jiri Slaby discovered that tty_driver_lookup_tty() may leak a reference to the tty driver. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2012-6689

Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered that non-root user-space processes can send forged Netlink notifications to other processes. A local user could use this flaw for denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-3184

Ben Hawkes discovered that various HID drivers may over-read the report descriptor buffer, possibly resulting in a crash if a HID with a crafted descriptor is plugged in.

CVE-2014-8159

It was found that the Linux kernel's InfiniBand/RDMA subsystem did not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.

CVE-2014-9683

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting in local denial of service.

CVE-2014-9728 / CVE-2014-9729 / CVE-2014-9730 / CVE-2014-9731 / CVE-2015-4167

Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing several necessary length checks. A local user that can mount devices could use these various flaws to crash the system, to leak information from the kernel, or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1805

Red Hat discovered that the pipe iovec read and write implementations may iterate over the iovec twice but will modify the iovec such that the second iteration accesses the wrong memory. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly for privilege escalation.
This may also result in data corruption and information leaks in pipes between non-malicious processes.

CVE-2015-2041

Sasha Levin discovered that the LLC subsystem exposed some variables as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this possibly allows privilege escalation from a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability; it also results in a trivial information leak.

CVE-2015-2042

Sasha Levin discovered that the RDS subsystem exposed some variables as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this results in a trivial information leak.

CVE-2015-2830

Andrew Lutomirski discovered that when a 64-bit task on an amd64 kernel makes a fork(2) or clone(2) system call using int shx80, the 32-bit compatibility flag is set (correctly) but is not cleared on return. As a result, both seccomp and audit will misinterpret the following system call by the task(s), possibly leading to a violation of security policy.

CVE-2015-2922

Modio AB discovered that the IPv6 subsystem would process a router advertisement that specifies no route but only a hop limit, which would then be applied to the interface that received it. This can result in loss of IPv6 connectivity beyond the local network.

This may be mitigated by disabling processing of IPv6 router advertisements if they are not needed: sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0 sysctl net.ipv6.conf.<interface>.accept_ra=0

CVE-2015-3339

It was found that the execve(2) system call can race with inode attribute changes made by chown(2). Although chown(2) clears the setuid/setgid bits of a file if it changes the respective owner ID, this race condition could result in execve(2) setting effective uid/gid to the new owner ID, a privilege escalation.

For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze12.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems were fixed in linux version 3.2.68-1+deb7u1 or earlier, except for CVE-2015-1805 and CVE-2015-4167 which will be fixed soon.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems were fixed in linux version 3.16.7-ckt11-1 or earlier, except for CVE-2015-4167 which will be fixed later.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 packages.

  - CVE-2015-5364: A remote denial of service (hang) via UDP     flood with incorrect package checksums was fixed.
    (bsc#936831).

  - CVE-2015-5366: A remote denial of service (unexpected     error returns) via UDP flood with incorrect package     checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).

  - CVE-2015-1420: A race condition in the handle_to_path     function in fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel allowed     local users to bypass intended size restrictions and     trigger read operations on additional memory locations     by changing the handle_bytes value of a file handle     during the execution of this function (bnc#915517).

  - CVE-2015-4700: A local user could have created a bad     instruction in the JIT processed BPF code, leading to a     kernel crash (bnc#935705).

  - CVE-2015-4167: The UDF filesystem in the Linux kernel     was vulnerable to a crash which could occur while     fetching inode information from a corrupted/malicious     udf file system image. (bsc#933907).

  - CVE-2014-9728 CVE-2014-9729 CVE-2014-9730 CVE-2014-9731:
    Various issues in handling UDF filesystems in the Linux     kernel allowed the corruption of kernel memory and other     issues. An attacker able to mount a corrupted/malicious     UDF file system image could cause the kernel to crash.
    (bsc#933904 bsc#933896)

  - CVE-2015-2150: The Linux kernel did not properly     restrict access to PCI command registers, which might     have allowed local guest users to cause a denial of     service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by     disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI     Express device and then accessing the device, which     triggers an Unsupported Request (UR) response     (bsc#919463).

  - CVE-2015-0777: drivers/xen/usbback/usbback.c as used in     the Linux kernel 2.6.x and 3.x in SUSE Linux     distributions, allowed guest OS users to obtain     sensitive information from uninitialized locations in     host OS kernel memory via unspecified vectors     (bnc#917830).

  - CVE-2015-2830: arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S in the Linux     kernel did not prevent the TS_COMPAT flag from reaching     a user-mode task, which might have allowed local users     to bypass the seccomp or audit protection mechanism via     a crafted application that uses the (1) fork or (2)     close system call, as demonstrated by an attack against     seccomp before 3.16 (bnc#926240).

  - CVE-2015-1805: The Linux kernels implementation of     vectored pipe read and write functionality did not take     into account the I/O vectors that were already processed     when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,     potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O     vector array overrun. A local, unprivileged user could     use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,     escalate their privileges on the system. (bsc#933429).

Following security bugs were fixed :

  - CVE-2015-6252: Possible file descriptor leak for each     VHOST_SET_LOG_FDcommand issued, this could eventually     wasting available system resources and creating a denial     of service (bsc#942367).

  - CVE-2015-5707: Possible integer overflow in the     calculation of total number of pages in     bio_map_user_iov() (bsc#940338).

  - CVE-2015-5364: The (1) udp_recvmsg and (2) udpv6_recvmsg     functions in the Linux kernel before 4.0.6 do not     properly consider yielding a processor, which allowed     remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system     hang) via incorrect checksums within a UDP packet flood     (bsc#936831).

  - CVE-2015-5366: The (1) udp_recvmsg and (2) udpv6_recvmsg     functions in the Linux kernel before 4.0.6 provide     inappropriate -EAGAIN return values, which allowed     remote attackers to cause a denial of service (EPOLLET     epoll application read outage) via an incorrect checksum     in a UDP packet, a different vulnerability than     CVE-2015-5364 (bsc#936831).

  - CVE-2015-1420: Race condition in the handle_to_path     function in fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel through     3.19.1 allowed local users to bypass intended size     restrictions and trigger read operations on additional     memory locations by changing the handle_bytes value of a     file handle during the execution of this function     (bsc#915517).

  - CVE-2015-1805: The (1) pipe_read and (2) pipe_write     implementations in fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before     3.16 do not properly consider the side effects of failed
    __copy_to_user_inatomic and __copy_from_user_inatomic     calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of     service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a     crafted application, aka an 'I/O' vector array overrun.
    (bsc#933429)

  - CVE-2015-2150: Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x and the Linux     kernel through 3.19.1 do not properly restrict access to     PCI command registers, which might allow local guest     users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable     interrupt and host crash) by disabling the (1) memory or     (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device and then     accessing the device, which triggers an Unsupported     Request (UR) response.

  - CVE-2015-4700: The bpf_int_jit_compile function in     arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c in the Linux kernel before     4.0.6 allowed local users to cause a denial of service     (system crash) by creating a packet filter and then     loading crafted BPF instructions that trigger late     convergence by the JIT compiler (bsc#935705).

  - CVE-2015-4167: The udf_read_inode function in     fs/udf/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19.1 did not     validate certain length values, which allowed local     users to cause a denial of service (incorrect data     representation or integer overflow, and OOPS) via a     crafted UDF filesystem (bsc#933907).

  - CVE-2015-0777: drivers/xen/usbback/usbback.c in     linux-2.6.18-xen-3.4.0 (aka the Xen 3.4.x support     patches for the Linux kernel 2.6.18), as used in the     Linux kernel 2.6.x and 3.x in SUSE Linux distributions,     allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information     from uninitialized locations in host OS kernel memory     via unspecified vectors. (bsc#917830)

  - CVE-2014-9728: The UDF filesystem implementation in the     Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not validate certain     lengths, which allowed local users to cause a denial of     service (buffer over-read and system crash) via a     crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/inode.c and     fs/udf/symlink.c (bsc#933904).

  - CVE-2014-9730: The udf_pc_to_char function in     fs/udf/symlink.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2     relies on component lengths that are unused, which     allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system     crash) via a crafted UDF filesystem image (bsc#933904).

  - CVE-2014-9729: The udf_read_inode function in     fs/udf/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not     ensure a certain data-structure size consistency, which     allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system     crash) via a crafted UDF filesystem image (bsc#933904).

  - CVE-2014-9731: The UDF filesystem implementation in the     Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not ensure that space is     available for storing a symlink target's name along with     a trailing   character, which allowed local users to     obtain sensitive information via a crafted filesystem     image, related to fs/udf/symlink.c and fs/udf/unicode.c     (bsc#933896).
