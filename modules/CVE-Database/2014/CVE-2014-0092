The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)

The CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this issue. For the update to take effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-10, plugin id: 72793, published: 2014-03-04, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=72793, title: RHEL 6 : gnutls (RHSA-2014:0246)}, {NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2014-3493.NASL, description: Version 3.1.22 (released 2014-03-03)

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)

A flaw was found in the way the get_rx_bufs() function in the vhost_net implementation in the Linux kernel handled error conditions reported by the vhost_get_vq_desc() function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2014-0055)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's cdc-wdm driver, used for USB CDC WCM device management. An attacker with physical access to a system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1860)

The CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers :

CVE-2014-0101, and CVE-2014-0069 (kernel issues)

CVE-2010-2596, CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-1961, CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4232, CVE-2013-4243, and CVE-2013-4244 (libtiff issues)
