Glibc pointer guarding weakness

A weakness in the dynamic loader prior has been found. The issue is that the LD_POINTER_GUARD in the environment is not sanitized allowing local attackers easily to bypass the pointer guarding protection on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.

Potential application crash due to overread in fnmatch

When processing certain malformed patterns, fnmatch can skip over the NUL byte terminating the pattern. This can potentially result in an application crash if fnmatch hits an unmapped page before encountering a NUL byte.

_IO_wstr_overflow integer overflow

A miscalculation in _IO_wstr_overflow could potentially be exploited to overflow a buffer.

CVE-2014-8121

DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS) in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.21 and earlier does not properly check if a file is open, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by performing a look-up while the database is iterated over the database, which triggers the file pointer to be reset.

For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 2.11.3-4+deb6u7.

We recommend that you update your packages.

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library:
      The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered a stack-based buffer         overflow in the send_dg() and send_vc() functions due to a buffer         mismanagement when getaddrinfo() is called with AF_UNSPEC         (CVE-2015-7547).

      Multiple unbounded stack allocations were found in the catopen()         function (CVE-2015-8779).
    Please review the CVEs referenced below for additional vulnerabilities       that had already been fixed in previous versions of sys-libs/glibc, for       which we have not issued a GLSA before.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could exploit any application which performs host name       resolution using getaddrinfo() in order to execute arbitrary code or       crash the application. The other vulnerabilities can possibly be       exploited to cause a Denial of Service or leak information.

The CVE-2015-7547 vulnerability listed below is considered to have critical impact.

  - CVE-2014-8121     Robin Hack discovered that the nss_files database did     not correctly implement enumeration interleaved with     name-based or ID-based lookups. This could cause the     enumeration enter an endless loop, leading to a denial     of service.

  - CVE-2015-1781     Arjun Shankar discovered that the _r variants of host     name resolution functions (like gethostbyname_r), when     performing DNS name resolution, suffered from a buffer     overflow if a misaligned buffer was supplied by the     applications, leading to a crash or, potentially,     arbitrary code execution. Most applications are not     affected by this vulnerability because they use aligned     buffers.

  - CVE-2015-7547     The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered that the     eglibc host name resolver function, getaddrinfo, when     processing AF_UNSPEC queries (for dual A/AAAA lookups),     could mismanage its internal buffers, leading to a     stack-based buffer overflow and arbitrary code     execution. This vulnerability affects most applications     which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,     including system services.

  - CVE-2015-8776     Adam Nielsen discovered that if an invalid separated     time value is passed to strftime, the strftime function     could crash or leak information. Applications normally     pass only valid time information to strftime; no     affected applications are known.

  - CVE-2015-8777     Hector Marco-Gisbert reported that LD_POINTER_GUARD was     not ignored for SUID programs, enabling an unintended     bypass of a security feature. This update causes eglibc     to always ignore the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment     variable.

  - CVE-2015-8778     Szabolcs Nagy reported that the rarely-used hcreate and     hcreate_r functions did not check the size argument     properly, leading to a crash (denial of service) for     certain arguments. No impacted applications are known at     this time.

  - CVE-2015-8779     The catopen function contains several unbound stack     allocations (stack overflows), causing it the crash the     process (denial of service). No applications where this     issue has a security impact are currently known.

The following fixed vulnerabilities currently lack CVE assignment :

  - Joseph Myers reported that an integer overflow in the     strxfrm can lead to heap-based buffer overflow, possibly     allowing arbitrary code execution. In addition, a     fallback path in strxfrm uses an unbounded stack     allocation (stack overflow), leading to a crash or     erroneous application behavior.
  - Kostya Serebryany reported that the fnmatch function     could skip over the terminating NUL character of a     malformed pattern, causing an application calling     fnmatch to crash (denial of service).

  - Joseph Myers reported that the IO_wstr_overflow     function, internally used by wide-oriented character     streams, suffered from an integer overflow, leading to a     heap-based buffer overflow. On GNU/Linux systems,     wide-oriented character streams are rarely used, and no     affected applications are known.

  - Andreas Schwab reported a memory leak (memory allocation     without a matching deallocation) while processing     certain DNS answers in getaddrinfo, related to the
    _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r function. This vulnerability     could lead to a denial of service.

While it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using the old eglibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after applying the security upgrade., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-10, plugin id: 88767, published: 2016-02-17, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=88767, title: Debian DSA-3480-1 : eglibc - security update}, {NASL family: SuSE Local Security Checks, NASL id: OPENSUSE-2015-383.NASL, description: glibc was updated to fix security issues and bugs :

Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way glibc's iconv() function converted certain encoded data to UTF-8. An attacker able to make an application call the iconv() function with a specially crafted argument could use this flaw to crash that application.
(CVE-2014-6040)

It was found that the files back end of Name Service Switch (NSS) did not isolate iteration over an entire database from key-based look-up API calls. An application performing look-ups on a database while iterating over it could enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-8121)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* Due to problems with buffer extension and reallocation, the nscd daemon terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault when processing long netgroup entries. With this update, the handling of long netgroup entries has been corrected and nscd no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1138520)

* If a file opened in append mode was truncated with the ftruncate() function, a subsequent ftell() call could incorrectly modify the file offset. This update ensures that ftell() modifies the stream state only when it is in append mode and the buffer for the stream is not empty. (BZ#1156331)

* A defect in the C library headers caused builds with older compilers to generate incorrect code for the btowc() function in the older compatibility C++ standard library. Applications calling btowc() in the compatibility C++ standard library became unresponsive. With this update, the C library headers have been corrected, and the compatibility C++ standard library shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux has been rebuilt. Applications that rely on the compatibility C++ standard library no longer hang when calling btowc(). (BZ#1120490)

* Previously, when using netgroups and the nscd daemon was set up to cache netgroup information, the sudo utility denied access to valid users. The bug in nscd has been fixed, and sudo now works in netgroups as expected. (BZ#1080766)

Users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these issues., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-18, plugin id: 81722, published: 2015-03-10, reporter: Tenable,
