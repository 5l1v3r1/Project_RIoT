As such, it may be affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A double-free error exists related to the handling of     server name extension data and specially crafted TLS     1.0 'Client Hello' packets. This can cause application     crashes. Note that successful exploitation requires that     OpenSSL is compiled with the TLS server name extensions.
    (CVE-2008-0891)

  - A NULL pointer dereference error exists related to     anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange and TLS     handshakes. This can be exploited by omitting the     'Server Key exchange message' from the handshake and     can cause application crashes. (CVE-2008-1672)

  - On 32-bit builds, an information disclosure     vulnerability exists during certain calculations for     NIST elliptic curves P-256 or P-384. This error can     allow an attacker to recover the private key of the TLS     server. 

    The following are required for exploitation :

      - 32-bit build
      - Use of elliptic curves P-256 and/or P-384
      - Either the use of ECDH family ciphers and/or the         use of ECDHE family ciphers without the         SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE context option

Testing using the Codenomicon TLS test suite discovered a flaw if the 'Server Key exchange message' is omitted from a TLS handshake in OpenSSL 0.9.8f and OpenSSL 0.9.8g.

    Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto of Codenomicon discovered two     vulnerabilities:
    A double free() call in the TLS server name extension (CVE-2008-0891).
    The OpenSSL client code does not properly handle servers that omit the     Server Key Exchange message in the TLS handshake (CVE-2008-1672).
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could connect to a vulnerable server, or entice a     daemon to connect to a malicious server, causing a Denial of Service of     the daemon in both cases.
