    Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu reported     multiple character handling flaws related to the backspace character,     the '0x80' character, involving zero-length non-ASCII sequences in     multiple character sets, that could facilitate Cross-Site Scripting     attacks (CVE-2008-0416).
    The following vulnerability was reported in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey:
    regenrecht (via iDefense) reported a heap-based buffer overflow when     rendering an email message with an external MIME body (CVE-2008-0304).
    The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and     XULRunner:
    The fix for CVE-2008-1237 in Firefox 2.0.0.13     and SeaMonkey 1.1.9 introduced a new crash vulnerability     (CVE-2008-1380).
    hong and Gregory Fleischer each reported a     variant on earlier reported bugs regarding focus shifting in file input     controls (CVE-2008-0414).

  Impact :

    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web     page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly     leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It     is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary     files when submitting a form, to corrupt saved passwords for other     sites, to steal login credentials, or to conduct Cross-Site Scripting     and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed messages with external-body Multipurpose Internet Message Extensions (MIME) types. A HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0304)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed HTML mail content. A HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0412, CVE-2008-0413, CVE-2008-0415, CVE-2008-0419)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed HTML mail content. A HTML mail message containing specially crafted content could trick a user into surrendering sensitive information.
(CVE-2008-0420, CVE-2008-0591, CVE-2008-0593)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handles certain chrome URLs.
If a user has certain extensions installed, it could allow a malicious HTML mail message to steal sensitive session data. Note: this flaw does not affect a default installation of Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0418)

Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; the above issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird saves certain text files. If a remote site offers a file of type 'plain/text', rather than 'text/plain', Thunderbird will not show future 'text/plain' content to the user, forcing them to save those files locally to view the content. (CVE-2008-0592)
