Service Console update for DHCP and third-party library update    for DHCP client.

   DHCP is an Internet-standard protocol by which a computer can be    connected to a local network, ask to be given configuration    information, and receive from a server enough information to    configure itself as a member of that network.

   A stack-based buffer overflow in the script_write_params method in    ISC DHCP dhclient allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary    code via a crafted subnet-mask option.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0692 to this issue.

   An insecure temporary file use flaw was discovered in the DHCP    daemon's init script ('/etc/init.d/dhcpd'). A local attacker could    use this flaw to overwrite an arbitrary file with the output of the    'dhcpd -t' command via a symbolic link attack, if a system    administrator executed the DHCP init script with the 'configtest',    'restart', or 'reload' option.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-1893 to this issue.

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java     implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and     the associated Sun Alerts for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR     archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in     the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running     the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of     Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose     information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct     session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the     same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network     connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify     the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based     authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and     cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable     versions of the JRE.
    NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user     interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

It fixes the following security problems :

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or application to     list the contents of the home directory of the user     running the applet or application. (CVE-2008-5350)

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an untrusted     applet or application to read arbitrary memory locations     in the process that the applet or application is running     in. (CVE-2008-5346)

  - A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java Plug-in may     allow hidden code on a host to make network connections     to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using cookies     stored in the browser. (CVE-2008-5343)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)     with applet classloading may allow an untrusted applet     to read arbitrary files on a system that the applet runs     on and make network connections to hosts other than the     host it was loaded from. (CVE-2008-5344)

  - A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime     Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow an     untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
    For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself     permissions to read and write local files or execute     local applications that are accessible to the user     running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2008-5359)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment may     allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to     determine the location of the Java Web Start cache and     the username of the user running the Java Web Start     application. (CVE-2008-5341)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)     may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to     make network connections to hosts other than the host     that the application is downloaded from. (CVE-2008-5339)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with     launching Java Web Start applications may allow an     untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate     privileges. For example, an untrusted application may     grant itself permissions to read and write local files     or execute local applications that are accessible to the     user running the untrusted application. (CVE-2008-5340)

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with authenticating users through Kerberos may     lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the system as a     whole, due to excessive consumption of operating system     resources. (CVE-2008-5348)

  - A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow certain     trusted operations to be performed, such as modifying     system properties. (CVE-2008-2086)

  - The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded     from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may     allow code that is maliciously placed on the local     filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network     access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed     if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be     leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for     domains that map a name to the localhost).
    (CVE-2008-5345)

  - The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) decoder in     the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts encodings     that are longer than the 'shortest' form. This behavior     is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may be     leveraged to exploit systems running software that     relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest     form sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences     may be decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow     files that are not otherwise accessible to be read, if     the URIs are not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
    (CVE-2008-5351)

  - The Java Runtime Environment creates temporary files     with insufficiently random names. This may be leveraged     to write JAR files which may then be loaded as untrusted     applets and Java Web Start applications to access and     provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
    (CVE-2008-5360)

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects may     allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate     privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant     itself permissions to read and write local files or     execute local applications that are accessible to the     user running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2008-5353)

  - A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted     applet or Java Web Start application to escalate     privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant     itself permissions to read and write local files or     execute local applications that are accessible to the     user running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2008-5356)

  - A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime     Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java     application that is launched through the command line to     escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java     application may grant itself permissions to read and     write local files or execute local applications that are     accessible to the user running the untrusted Java     application. (CVE-2008-5354)

This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or Java Web Start application.

  - A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an untrusted     applet or Java Web Start application to escalate     privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant     itself permissions to read and write local files or     execute local applications that are accessible to the     user running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2008-5357)

  - A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime     Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web     Start applications using the 'unpack200' JAR unpacking     utility may allow an untrusted applet or application to     escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet     may grant itself permissions to read and write local     files or execute local applications that are accessible     to the user running the untrusted applet.
    (CVE-2008-5352)

  - A security vulnerability in the the Java Web Start     BasicService allows untrusted applications that are     downloaded from another system to request local files to     be displayed by the browser of the user running the     untrusted application. (CVE-2008-5342)

It fixes lots of bugs and various security issues :

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or application to     list the contents of the home directory of the user     running the applet or application. (CVE-2008-5350)

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an untrusted     applet or application to read arbitrary memory locations     in the process that the applet or application is running     in. (CVE-2008-5346)

  - A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java Plug-in may     allow hidden code on a host to make network connections     to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using cookies     stored in the browser. (CVE-2008-5343)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)     with applet classloading may allow an untrusted applet     to read arbitrary files on a system that the applet runs     on and make network connections to hosts other than the     host it was loaded from. (CVE-2008-5344)

  - A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime     Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow an     untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
    For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself     permissions to read and write local files or execute     local applications that are accessible to the user     running the untrusted applet. (CVE-2008-5359)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)     may allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to     make network connections to hosts other than the host     that the application is downloaded from. (CVE-2008-5339)

  - A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with     launching Java Web Start applications may allow an     untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate     privileges. For example, an untrusted application may     grant itself permissions to read and write local files     or execute local applications that are accessible to the     user running the untrusted application. (CVE-2008-5340)

  - A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment     (JRE) with authenticating users through Kerberos may     lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the system as a     whole, due to excessive consumption of operating system     resources. (CVE-2008-5348)

  - A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow certain     trusted operations to be performed, such as modifying     system properties. (CVE-2008-2086)

  - The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows code loaded     from the local filesystem to access localhost. This may     allow code that is maliciously placed on the local     filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network     access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed     if the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be     leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for     domains that map a name to the localhost).
    (CVE-2008-5345)

  - The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8) decoder in     the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts encodings     that are longer than the 'shortest' form. This behavior     is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may be     leveraged to exploit systems running software that     relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest     form sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences     may be decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow     files that are not otherwise accessible to be read, if     the URIs are not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
    (CVE-2008-5351)

  - The Java Runtime Environment creates temporary files     with insufficiently random names. This may be leveraged     to write JAR files which may then be loaded as untrusted     applets and Java Web Start applications to access and     provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
