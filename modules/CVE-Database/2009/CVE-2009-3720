   GLib is the low-level core library that forms the basis for    projects such as GTK+ and GNOME. It provides data structure    handling for C, portability wrappers, and interfaces for such    runtime functionality as an event loop, threads, dynamic loading,    and an object system.

   Multiple integer overflows in glib/gbase64.c in GLib before 2.20    allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a    long string that is converted either from or to a base64    representation.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4316 to this issue.

d. vMA and Service Console update for openssl to 0.9.8e-12.el5

   SSL is a toolkit implementing SSL v2/v3 and TLS protocols with full-    strength cryptography world-wide.

   Multiple denial of service flaws were discovered in OpenSSL's DTLS    implementation. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a    DTLS server to use excessive amounts of memory, or crash on an    invalid memory access or NULL pointer dereference.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the names CVE-2009-1377, CVE-2009-1378,    CVE-2009-1379, CVE-2009-1386, CVE-2009-1387 to these issues.

   An input validation flaw was found in the handling of the BMPString    and UniversalString ASN1 string types in OpenSSL's    ASN1_STRING_print_ex() function. An attacker could use this flaw to    create a specially crafted X.509 certificate that could cause    applications using the affected function to crash when printing    certificate contents.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0590 to this issue.

e. vMA and Service Console package bind updated to 9.3.6-4.P1.el5_4.1

   It was discovered that BIND was incorrectly caching responses    without performing proper DNSSEC validation, when those responses    were received during the resolution of a recursive client query    that requested DNSSEC records but indicated that checking should be    disabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the DNSSEC    validation check and perform a cache poisoning attack if the target    BIND server was receiving such client queries.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-4022 to this issue.

f. vMA and Service Console package expat updated to 1.95.8-8.3.el5_4.2.

   Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way Expat handled    malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially-    crafted XML file could cause applications using Expat to fail while    parsing the file.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the names CVE-2009-3560 and CVE-2009-3720 to these    issues.

g. vMA and Service Console package openssh update to 4.3p2-36.el5_4.2

   A Red Hat specific patch used in the openssh packages as shipped in    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 (RHSA-2009:1287) loosened certain    ownership requirements for directories used as arguments for the    ChrootDirectory configuration options. A malicious user that also    has or previously had non-chroot shell access to a system could    possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges and run    commands as any system user.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-2904 to this issue.

h. vMA and Service Console package ntp updated to    ntp-4.2.2p1-9.el5_4.1.i386.rpm

   A flaw was discovered in the way ntpd handled certain malformed NTP    packets. ntpd logged information about all such packets and replied    with an NTP packet that was treated as malformed when received by    another ntpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create an NTP    packet reply loop between two ntpd servers through a malformed packet    with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those    servers to use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with    log messages.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)    has assigned the name CVE-2009-3563 to this issue.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

A flaw was found in the Python urllib and urllib2 libraries where they would not differentiate between different target URLs when handling automatic redirects. This caused Python applications using these modules to follow any new URL that they understood, including the 'file://' URL type. This could allow a remote server to force a local Python application to read a local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files that were not meant to be exposed.
(CVE-2011-1521)

A race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new connections. A remote user could use this flaw to cause a Python script using the smtpd module to terminate. (CVE-2010-3493)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted request to obtain the CGI script's source code. (CVE-2011-1015)

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

A flaw was found in the Python urllib and urllib2 libraries where they would not differentiate between different target URLs when handling automatic redirects. This caused Python applications using these modules to follow any new URL that they understood, including the 'file://' URL type. This could allow a remote server to force a local Python application to read a local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files that were not meant to be exposed.
(CVE-2011-1521)

Multiple flaws were found in the Python audioop module. Supplying certain inputs could cause the audioop module to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)

A race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new connections. A remote user could use this flaw to cause a Python script using the smtpd module to terminate. (CVE-2010-3493)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted request to obtain the CGI script's source code. (CVE-2011-1015)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the Python Expat parser handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially crafted XML file could cause Python applications using the Python Expat parser to crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

A flaw was found in the Python urllib and urllib2 libraries where they would not differentiate between different target URLs when handling automatic redirects. This caused Python applications using these modules to follow any new URL that they understood, including the 'file://' URL type. This could allow a remote server to force a local Python application to read a local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files that were not meant to be exposed.
(CVE-2011-1521)

A race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new connections. A remote user could use this flaw to cause a Python script using the smtpd module to terminate. (CVE-2010-3493)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted request to obtain the CGI script's source code. (CVE-2011-1015)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the Python Expat parser handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially crafted XML file could cause Python applications using the Python Expat parser to crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)

This update makes Python use the system Expat library rather than its own internal copy; therefore, users must have the version of Expat shipped with RHSA-2009:1625 installed, or a later version, to resolve the CVE-2009-3720 issue.
