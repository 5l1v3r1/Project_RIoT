Updated bind packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

[Updated 29th July 2009] The packages in this erratum have been updated to also correct this issue in the bind-sdb package.

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)

Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such a specially crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit unexpectedly.

All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-18, plugin id: 67899, published: 2013-07-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=67899, title: Oracle Linux 5 : bind (ELSA-2009-1179)}, {NASL family: Scientific Linux Local Security Checks, NASL id: SL_20090730_BIND_SECURITY_FOR_SL_4_X.NASL, description: CVE-2009-0696 bind: DoS (assertion failure) via nsupdate packets

A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)

Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such a specially crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit unexpectedly.

This update also fixes the following bug :

  - when running on a system receiving a large number of     (greater than 4,000) DNS requests per second, the named     DNS nameserver became unresponsive, and the named     service had to be restarted in order for it to continue     serving requests. This was caused by a deadlock     occurring between two threads that led to the inability     of named to continue to service requests. This deadlock     has been resolved with these updated packages so that     named no longer becomes unresponsive under heavy load.

 f. Updated Service Console package python

  Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.

  When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization   flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that   led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values   meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than   expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the   Python interpreter's privileges.

  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python   Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string   object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause   a denial of service.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop   module. If a Python application used the imageop module to   process untrusted images, it could cause the application to   disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute   arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.

  Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the   Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use   these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python   modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of   service.

  An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was   found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application   requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression   stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,   execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.

  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python   locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly   NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data   stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721   CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143   CVE-2008-3144 CVE-2008-4864 CVE-2008-5031 to these issues.

 g. Updated Service Console package bind

  Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the   Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server   (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when   interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server   is operating correctly.

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message   packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet   that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

 h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

  Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

  libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A   Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also   which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML   files.

  A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the   root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

  Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses   the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these   issues.

 i. Updated Service Console package curl

  Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5_3.5

  A cURL is affected by the previously published 'null prefix attack',   caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509   certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted   certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker   could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and   potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue

 j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

  Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5_3.5

  A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in   certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority   trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the   certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially   confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such a specially crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit unexpectedly.

This update also fixes the following bug :

* the following message could have been logged: 'internal_accept:
fcntl() failed: Too many open files'. With these updated packages, timeout queries are aborted in order to reduce the number of open UDP sockets, and when the accept() function returns an EMFILE error value, that situation is now handled gracefully, thus resolving the issue.
(BZ#498164)

    Matthias Urlichs reported that the dns_db_findrdataset() function fails     when the prerequisite section of the dynamic update message contains a     record of type 'ANY' and where at least one RRset for this FQDN exists     on the server.
  Impact :

    A remote unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted     dynamic update message to the BIND daemon (named), leading to a Denial     of Service (daemon crash). This vulnerability affects all primary     (master) servers -- it is not limited to those that are configured to     allow dynamic updates.
  Workaround :

    Configure a firewall that performs Deep Packet Inspection to prevent     nsupdate messages from reaching named. Alternatively, expose only     secondary (slave) servers to untrusted networks., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 40463, published: 2009-08-03, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=40463, title: GLSA-200908-02 : BIND: Denial of Service}, {NASL family: FreeBSD Local Security Checks, NASL id: FREEBSD_PKG_83725C917C7E11DE967200E0815B8DA8.NASL, description: When named(8) receives a specially crafted dynamic update message an internal assertion check is triggered which causes named(8) to exit.

To trigger the problem, the dynamic update message must contains a record of type 'ANY' and at least one resource record set (RRset) for this fully qualified domain name (FQDN) must exist on the server.
Impact : An attacker which can send DNS requests to a nameserver can cause it to exit, thus creating a Denial of Service situation.
Workaround : No generally applicable workaround is available, but some firewalls may be able to prevent nsupdate DNS packets from reaching the nameserver.
