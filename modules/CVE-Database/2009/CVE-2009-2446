MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

MySQL did not correctly check directories used as arguments for the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives. Using this flaw, an authenticated attacker could elevate their access privileges to tables created by other database users. Note: This attack does not work on existing tables. An attacker can only elevate their access to another user's tables as the tables are created. As well, the names of these created tables need to be predicted correctly for this attack to succeed. (CVE-2008-2079)

A flaw was found in the way MySQL handles an empty bit-string literal.
A remote, authenticated attacker could crash the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) if they used an empty bit-string literal in a SQL statement.
This issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as the MySQL daemon was automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2008-3963)

An insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command line client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary HTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved using the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the HTML output in a web browser.
(CVE-2008-4456)

Multiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logs user commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated attacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these flaws to formulate a specifically-crafted SQL command that would cause a temporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated). (CVE-2009-2446)

Note: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld '--log' command line option or the 'log' option in '/etc/my.cnf') must be enabled. This logging is not enabled by default.

This update also fixes multiple bugs. Details regarding these bugs can be found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 Technical Notes. You can find a link to the Technical Notes in the References section of this errata.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

Multiple flaws were discovered in the way MySQL handled symbolic links to tables created using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives in CREATE TABLE statements. An attacker with CREATE and DROP table privileges and shell access to the database server could use these flaws to escalate their database privileges, or gain access to tables created by other database users. (CVE-2008-4098, CVE-2009-4030)

Note: Due to the security risks and previous security issues related to the use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives, users not depending on this feature should consider disabling it by adding 'symbolic-links=0' to the '[mysqld]' section of the 'my.cnf' configuration file. In this update, an example of such a configuration was added to the default 'my.cnf' file.

An insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command line client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary HTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved using the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the HTML output in a web browser.
(CVE-2008-4456)

Multiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logged user commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated attacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these flaws to formulate a specially crafted SQL command that would cause a temporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated). (CVE-2009-2446)

Note: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld '--log' command line option or the 'log' option in 'my.cnf') must be enabled. This logging is not enabled by default.

All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. (CVE-2008-4456)

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10. (CVE-2008-7247)

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. (CVE-2009-2446)

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2009-4019)

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later time, bypassing access restrictions. (CVE-2009-4030)

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor MySQL profile. (CVE-2009-4484).

MySQL 5.0 before 5.0.66, 5.1 before 5.1.26, and 6.0 before 6.0.6 does not properly handle a b'' (b single-quote single-quote) token, aka an empty bit-string literal, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by using this token in a SQL statement (CVE-2008-3963).

MySQL before 5.0.67 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of the MySQL home data directory.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4097 (CVE-2008-4098).

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the command-line client in MySQL 5.0.26 through 5.0.45, when the --html option is enabled, allows attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by placing it in a database cell, which might be accessed by this client when composing an HTML document (CVE-2008-4456).

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the dispatch_command function in libmysqld/sql_parse.cc in mysqld in MySQL 4.0.0 through 5.0.83 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via format string specifiers in a database name in a (1) COM_CREATE_DB or (2) COM_DROP_DB request.

CVE-2009-2446 MySQL: Format string vulnerability by manipulation with database instances (crash)

CVE-2009-4030 mysql: Incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079 / CVE-2008-4098

Multiple flaws were discovered in the way MySQL handled symbolic links to tables created using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives in CREATE TABLE statements. An attacker with CREATE and DROP table privileges and shell access to the database server could use these flaws to escalate their database privileges, or gain access to tables created by other database users. (CVE-2008-4098, CVE-2009-4030)

Note: Due to the security risks and previous security issues related to the use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives, users not depending on this feature should consider disabling it by adding 'symbolic-links=0' to the '[mysqld]' section of the 'my.cnf' configuration file. In this update, an example of such a configuration was added to the default 'my.cnf' file.

An insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command line client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary HTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved using the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the HTML output in a web browser.
(CVE-2008-4456)

Multiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logged user commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated attacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these flaws to formulate a specially crafted SQL command that would cause a temporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated). (CVE-2009-2446)

Note: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld '--log' command line option or the 'log' option in 'my.cnf') must be enabled. This logging is not enabled by default.

After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2019-01-02, plugin id: 60735, published: 2012-08-01, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=60735, title: Scientific Linux Security Update : mysql on SL4.x i386/x86_64}, {NASL family: CentOS Local Security Checks, NASL id: CENTOS_RHSA-2010-0110.NASL, description: Updated mysql packages that fix several security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.
