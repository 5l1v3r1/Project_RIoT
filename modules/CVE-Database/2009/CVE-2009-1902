    Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ModSecurity:
    Juan Galiana Lara of ISecAuditors discovered a NULL pointer     dereference when processing multipart requests without a part header     name (CVE-2009-1902).
    Steve Grubb of Red Hat reported that the     'PDF XSS protection' feature does not properly handle HTTP requests to     a PDF file that do not use the GET method (CVE-2009-1903).
  Impact :

    A remote attacker might send requests containing specially crafted     multipart data or send certain requests to access a PDF file, possibly     resulting in a Denial of Service (crash) of the Apache HTTP daemon.
    NOTE: The PDF XSS protection is not enabled by default.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 39596, published: 2009-07-03, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=39596, title: GLSA-200907-02 : ModSecurity: Denial of Service}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2009-06/msg00003.html, http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200907-02.xml, http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=667542&group_id=68846, http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/501968, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34096, http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/0703, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/49212, https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/8241, https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2009-March/msg00487.html, https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2009-March/msg00529.html], refmap: {bid: [34096], bugtraq: [20090319 [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] ModSecurity < 2.5.9 remote Denial of Service], confirm: [http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=667542&group_id=68846], exploit-db: [8241], fedora: [FEDORA-2009-2654, FEDORA-2009-2686], gentoo: [GLSA-200907-02], osvdb: [52553], secunia: [34256, 34311, 35687], suse: [SUSE-SR:2009:011], vupen: [ADV-2009-0703], xf: [modsecurity-multipart-dos(49212)]}, summary: The multipart processor in ModSecurity before 2.5.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a multipart form datapost request with a missing part header name, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.8, title: ModSecurity 2.5.8}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.6, title: ModSecurity 2.5.6}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.5, title: ModSecurity 2.5.5}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.7, title: ModSecurity 2.5.7}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.1.7, title: cpe:2.3:a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.1.7}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.8, cpe:/a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.6, cpe:/a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.5, cpe:/a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.5.7, cpe:/a:modsecurity:modsecurity:2.1.7]}
