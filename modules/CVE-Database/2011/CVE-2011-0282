    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MIT Kerberos 5. Please       review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the       privileges of the administration daemon or the Key Distribution Center       (KDC) daemon, cause a Denial of Service condition, or possibly obtain       sensitive information. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able to       spoof Kerberos authorization, modify KDC responses, forge user data       messages, forge tokens, forge signatures, impersonate a client, modify       user-visible prompt text, or have other unspecified impact.

The MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to denial of service attacks from unauthenticated remote attackers.
CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 occur only in KDCs using LDAP back ends, but CVE-2011-0283 occurs in all krb5-1.9 KDCs.

Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy to trigger manually. The trigger for CVE-2011-0281 has already been disclosed publicly, but that fact might not be obvious to casual readers of the message in which it was disclosed. The triggers for CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0283 have not yet been disclosed publicly, but they are also trivial.

CVE-2011-0281: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC configured with an LDAP back end to become completely unresponsive until restarted.

CVE-2011-0282: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a NULL pointer dereference.
