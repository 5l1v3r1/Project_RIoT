    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenLDAP. Please review       the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker might employ a specially crafted certificate to       conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections made using OpenLDAP,       bypass security restrictions or cause a Denial of Service condition.

chain.c in back-ldap in OpenLDAP 2.4.x before 2.4.24, when a master-slave configuration with a chain overlay and ppolicy_forward_updates (aka authentication-failure forwarding) is used, allows remote authenticated users to bypass external-program authentication by sending an invalid password to a slave server (CVE-2011-1024).

modrdn.c in slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.x before 2.4.24 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a relative Distinguished Name (DN) modification request (aka MODRDN operation) that contains an empty value for the OldDN field (CVE-2011-1081).

  OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access   Protocol) applications and development tools.

  A flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled authentication failures being   passed from an OpenLDAP slave to the master. If OpenLDAP was configured   with a chain overlay and it forwarded authentication failures, OpenLDAP   would bind to the directory as an anonymous user and return success, rather   than return failure on the authenticated bind. This could allow a user on a   system that uses LDAP for authentication to log into a directory-based   account without knowing the password. (CVE-2011-1024)

  It was found that the OpenLDAP back-ndb back end allowed successful   authentication to the root distinguished name (DN) when any string was   provided as a password. A remote user could use this flaw to access an   OpenLDAP directory if they knew the value of the root DN. Note: This issue   only affected OpenLDAP installations using the NDB back-end, which is only   available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via third-party software.
