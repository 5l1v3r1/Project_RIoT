    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in BIND. Please review the       CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
  Impact :

    The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service       (daemon crash) via a DNS query, to bypass intended access restrictions,       to incorrectly cache a ncache entry and a rrsig for the same type and to       incorrectly mark zone data as insecure.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 59629, published: 2012-06-21, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=59629, title: GLSA-201206-01 : BIND: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: DNS, NASL id: BIND9_980_P3.NASL, description: According to its self-reported version number, the remote installation of BIND is potentially affected by a denial of service vulnerability.
