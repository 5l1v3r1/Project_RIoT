This update also fixes an applet and connection editor crash caused by mis-packaging of some UI-related files, and corrects the path of iscsiadm. This update further adds the ability to delete connections from nmcli, correctly handles IPv6 link-local DNS servers when using the dnsmasq local caching nameserver plugin, and fixes connection timestamps for VPN connections.

Updated NetworkManager packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section.

NetworkManager is a network link manager that attempts to keep a wired or wireless network connection active at all times. The ifcfg-rh NetworkManager plug-in is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions to read and write configuration information from the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files.

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way the ifcfg-rh NetworkManager plug-in escaped network connection names containing special characters. If PolicyKit was configured to allow local, unprivileged users to create and save new network connections, they could create a connection with a specially crafted name, leading to the escalation of their privileges. Note: By default, PolicyKit prevents unprivileged users from creating and saving network connections. (CVE-2011-3364)

Red Hat would like to thank Matt McCutchen for reporting this issue.

Users of NetworkManager should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Running instances of NetworkManager must be restarted ('service NetworkManager restart') for this update to take effect., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-18, plugin id: 68358, published: 2013-07-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=68358, title: Oracle Linux 6 : NetworkManager (ELSA-2011-1338)}, {NASL family: Mandriva Local Security Checks, NASL id: MANDRIVA_MDVSA-2011-171.NASL, description: Security issues were identified and fixed in networkmanager :

GNOME NetworkManager before 0.8.6 does not properly enforce the auth_admin element in PolicyKit, which allows local users to bypass intended wireless network sharing restrictions via unspecified vectors (CVE-2011-2176).

Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the svEscape function in settings/plugins/ifcfg-rh/shvar.c in the ifcfg-rh plug-in for GNOME NetworkManager 0.9.1, 0.9.0, 0.8.1, and possibly other versions, when PolicyKit is configured to allow users to create new connections, allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a newline character in the name for a new network connection, which is not properly handled when writing to the ifcfg file (CVE-2011-3364).

Instead of patching networkmanager, the latest 0.8.6.0 stable version is being provided due to the large amount of bugs fixed upstream. Also the networkmanager-applet, networkmanager-openconnect, networkmanager-openvpn, networkmanager-pptp, networkmanager-vpnc is being provided with their latest 0.8.6.0 stable versions.
