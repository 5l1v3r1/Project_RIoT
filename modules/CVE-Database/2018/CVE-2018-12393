    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Thunderbird.
      Please review the referenced Mozilla Foundation Security Advisories and       CVE identifiers below for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, cause a Denial       of Service condition, obtain sensitive information, or conduct Cross-Site       Request Forgery (CSRF).
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-26, plugin id: 119133, published: 2018-11-26, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=119133, title: GLSA-201811-13 : Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: MacOS X Local Security Checks, NASL id: MACOSX_FIREFOX_63_0.NASL, description: The version of Mozilla Firefox installed on the remote macOS host is prior to 63. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio     data can be accessed across origins in violation of security     policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android     service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as     cross-origin and opaque to access. *Note: this issue only affects     Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*     (CVE-2018-12391)

  - When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a     document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially     exploitable crash due to poor event handling. (CVE-2018-12392)

  - A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an     integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal     UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too     small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds     write. *Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*     (CVE-2018-12393)

  - By rewriting the Host request headers using the webRequest API, a     WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain     fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host     that are otherwise restricted. (CVE-2018-12395)

  - A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in     disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This     allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on     sites where content scripts should not be run. (CVE-2018-12396)

  - A WebExtension can request access to local files without the     warning prompt stating that the extension will 'Access your data     for all websites' being displayed to the user. This allows     extensions to run content scripts in local pages without     permission warnings when a local file is opened. (CVE-2018-12397)

  - By using the reflected URL in some special resource URIs, such as     chrome:, it is possible to inject stylesheets and bypass Content     Security Policy (CSP). (CVE-2018-12398)

  - When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title     argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is     registering the new protocol. This may result in the user     approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.
    (CVE-2018-12399)

  - In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are     cached in the cache/icons folder as they are in non-private mode.
    This allows information leakage of sites visited during private     browsing sessions. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox for     Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*     (CVE-2018-12400)

  - Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if     loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed     string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.
    (CVE-2018-12401)

  - SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the 'Save     Page As...' menu item is selected to save a page, violating cookie     policy. This can result in saving the wrong version of resources     based on those cookies. (CVE-2018-12402)

  - If a site is loaded over a HTTPS connection but loads a favicon     resource over HTTP, the mixed content warning is not displayed to     users. (CVE-2018-12403)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Dana     Keeler, Ronald Crane, Marcia Knous, Tyson Smith, Daniel Veditz,     and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort that some of these could be     exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12388)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Bob     Owen, Boris Zbarsky, Calixte Denizet, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis,     Taegeon Lee, Philipp, Ronald Crane, Raul Gurzau, Gary Kwong, Tyson     Smith, Raymond Forbes, and Bogdan Tara reported memory safety bugs     present in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run     arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12390)

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android,     audio data can be accessed across origins in violation     of security policies. Because the problem is in the     underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by     treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to     access. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox for     Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*     (CVE-2018-12391)

  - When manipulating user events in nested loops while     opening a document through script, it is possible to     trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor     event handling. (CVE-2018-12392)

  - A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds     where an integer overflow during the conversion of     scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could     result in allocating a buffer too small for the     conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds     write. *Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this     issue.*     (CVE-2018-12393)

  - By rewriting the Host request headers using the     webRequest API, a WebExtension can bypass domain     restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow     access to domains that share a host that are     otherwise restricted. (CVE-2018-12395)

  - A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content     scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or     other events. This allows for potential privilege     escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content     scripts should not be run. (CVE-2018-12396)

  - A WebExtension can request access to local files     without the warning prompt stating that the extension     will 'Access your data for all websites' being displayed     to the user. This allows extensions to run content     scripts in local pages without permission warnings when     a local file is opened. (CVE-2018-12397)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Daniel     Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present     in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence     of memory corruption and we presume that with enough     effort that some of these could be exploited to run     arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12389)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Christian     Holler, Bob Owen, Boris Zbarsky, Calixte Denizet,     Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Taegeon Lee, Philipp, Ronald     Crane, Raul Gurzau, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Raymond     Forbes, and Bogdan Tara reported memory safety bugs     present in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of     these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort that some of these could     be exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12390)

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please       review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web       page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the       privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, bypass       access restriction, access otherwise protected information.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-09, plugin id: 118848, published: 2018-11-09, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=118848, title: GLSA-201811-04 : Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: Windows, NASL id: MOZILLA_FIREFOX_60_3_ESR.NASL, description: The version of Mozilla Firefox ESR installed on the remote Windows host is prior to 60.3. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android,     audio data can be accessed across origins in violation     of security policies. Because the problem is in the     underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by     treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to     access. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox for     Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*     (CVE-2018-12391)

  - When manipulating user events in nested loops while     opening a document through script, it is possible to     trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor     event handling. (CVE-2018-12392)

  - A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds     where an integer overflow during the conversion of     scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could     result in allocating a buffer too small for the     conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds     write. *Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to     this issue.* (CVE-2018-12393)

  - By rewriting the Host request headers using the     webRequest API, a WebExtension can bypass domain     restrictions through domain fronting. This would     allow access to domains that share a host that are     otherwise restricted. (CVE-2018-12395)

  - A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content     scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or     other events. This allows for potential privilege     escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content     scripts should not be run. (CVE-2018-12396)

  - A WebExtension can request access to local files     without the warning prompt stating that the extension     will 'Access your data for all websites' being displayed     to the user. This allows extensions to run content     scripts in local pages without permission warnings when     a local file is opened. (CVE-2018-12397)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Daniel     Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present     in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed     evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort that some of these could be exploited to     run arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12389)

  - Mozilla developers and community members Christian     Holler, Bob Owen, Boris Zbarsky, Calixte Denizet, Jason     Kratzer, Jed Davis, Taegeon Lee, Philipp, Ronald Crane,     Raul Gurzau, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Raymond Forbes,     and Bogdan Tara reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that     with enough effort that some of these could be     exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12390)

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the 60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For more information please refer to https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version 1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.
