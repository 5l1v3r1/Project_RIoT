The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section.

The dynamic LDAP back end is a plug-in for BIND that provides back-end capabilities to LDAP databases. It features support for dynamic updates and internal caching that help to reduce the load on LDAP servers.

A flaw was found in the way bind-dyndb-ldap handled LDAP query errors.
If a remote attacker were able to send DNS queries to a named server that is configured to use bind-dyndb-ldap, they could trigger such an error with a DNS query leveraging bind-dyndb-ldap's insufficient escaping of the LDAP base DN (distinguished name). This would result in an invalid LDAP query that named would retry in a loop, preventing it from responding to other DNS queries. With this update, bind-dyndb-ldap only attempts to retry one time when an LDAP search returns an unexpected error. (CVE-2012-2134)

Red Hat would like to thank Ronald van Zantvoort for reporting this issue.
