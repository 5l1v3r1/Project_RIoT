Such versions are affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - The HostScan VPN downloader implementation does not     compare timestamps of offered software to install     with currently installed software, which may allow     remote attackers to downgrade the software via ActiveX     or Java components. (CVE-2012-2495)

  - Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible even when the     ASA is configured with a legitimate certificate.
    (CVE-2012-2498)

  - No certificate name checking is performed when using     IPsec as the tunnel protocol, which could result in     man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2499)

  - Certificate names are not verified during WebLaunch     of IPsec, which could result in man-in-the-middle     attacks.
