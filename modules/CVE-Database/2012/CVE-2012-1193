It is, therefore, affected by a ghost domain names vulnerability in the resolver service due to overwriting cached name servers and TTL values in NS records when processing a response of an A record query. A remote attacker can exploit this to resume the resolving of revoked domain names.

Note that Nessus has not attempted to exploit this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-25, plugin id: 69429, published: 2013-07-25, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=69429, title: PowerDNS Recursor 3.3.x / 3.4.x / 3.5 RC1 Cache Update Policy Deleted Domain Name Resolving Weakness}, {NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2013-6316.NASL, description: - Update to 3.5

    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PowerDNS Recursor.
      Please review the CVE identifiers and PowerDNS blog post referenced below       for details.
  Impact :

    A remote attacker may be able to send specially crafted packets,       possibly resulting in arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service       condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able to spoof DNS data.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2017-10-02, plugin id: 80210, published: 2014-12-23, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=80210, title: GLSA-201412-33 : PowerDNS Recursor: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2013-6279.NASL, description: - Update to 3.5
