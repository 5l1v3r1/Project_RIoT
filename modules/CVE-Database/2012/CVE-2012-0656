The attacker has the ability to modify the resource., related_weakness: [368, 363, 366, 370, 362, 662, 689, 667, 665], solutions: Use safe libraries to access resources such as files.
Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition.
Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.
Use static analysis tools to find race conditions.
Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources., summary: This attack targets a race condition occurring when multiple processes access and manipulate the same resource concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place. The attacker can leverage a race condition by "running the race", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance a race condition can occur while accessing a file, the attacker can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file.}, {id: 29, name: Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions, prerequisites: A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

Use static analysis tools to find race conditions.
Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources., summary: This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. The typical example is the file access. The attacker can leverage a file access race condition by "running the race", meaning that he would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the attacker could do something such as replace the file and cause an escalation of privilege.}], cvss: 6.9, cvss-time: 2012-05-11T10:12:00, cwe: CWE-362, id: CVE-2012-0656, impact: {availability: COMPLETE, confidentiality: COMPLETE, integrity: COMPLETE}, last-modified: 2017-12-04T21:29:02.997000, nessus: [{NASL family: MacOS X Local Security Checks, NASL id: MACOSX_10_7_4.NASL, description: The remote host is running a version of Mac OS X 10.7.x that is prior to 10.7.4.

Note that this update addresses the recent FileVault password vulnerability, in which user passwords are stored in plaintext to a system-wide debug log if the legacy version of FileVault is used to encrypt user directories after a system upgrade to Lion. Since the patch only limits further exposure, though, we recommend that all users on the system change their passwords if user folders were encrypted using the legacy version of FileVault prior to and after an upgrade to OS X 10.7., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-16, plugin id: 59066, published: 2012-05-10, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=59066, title: Mac OS X 10.7.x < 10.7.4 Multiple Vulnerabilities (BEAST)}], references: [http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2012/May/msg00001.html, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5281, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53445, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53459], refmap: {apple: [APPLE-SA-2012-05-09-1], bid: [53445, 53459], confirm: [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5281]}, summary: Race condition in LoginUIFramework in Apple Mac OS X 10.7.x before 10.7.4, when the Guest account is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to login to arbitrary accounts by entering the account name and no password., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.0, title: Apple Mac OS X 10.7.0}, {id: cpe:2.3:o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.1, title: Apple Mac OS X 10.7.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.2, title: Apple Mac OS X 10.7.2}, {id: cpe:2.3:o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.3, title: Apple Mac OS X 10.7.3}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.0, cpe:/o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.1, cpe:/o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.2, cpe:/o:apple:mac_os_x:10.7.3]}
