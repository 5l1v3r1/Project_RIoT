The attacker has the ability to modify the resource., related_weakness: [368, 363, 366, 370, 362, 662, 689, 667, 665], solutions: Use safe libraries to access resources such as files.
Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition.
Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.
Use static analysis tools to find race conditions.
Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources., summary: This attack targets a race condition occurring when multiple processes access and manipulate the same resource concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place. The attacker can leverage a race condition by "running the race", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance a race condition can occur while accessing a file, the attacker can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file.}, {id: 29, name: Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions, prerequisites: A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.
The attacker is able to modify resource.
A race condition exists while accessing a resource., related_weakness: [367, 368, 366, 370, 362, 662, 691, 663, 665], solutions: Use safe libraries to access resources such as files.
Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition.
Use synchronization to control the flow of execution.
Use static analysis tools to find race conditions.
Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources., summary: This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. The typical example is the file access. The attacker can leverage a file access race condition by "running the race", meaning that he would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the attacker could do something such as replace the file and cause an escalation of privilege.}], cvss: 6.9, cvss-time: 2012-06-13T09:05:00, cwe: CWE-362, id: CVE-2012-1868, impact: {availability: COMPLETE, confidentiality: COMPLETE, integrity: COMPLETE}, last-modified: 2018-10-12T18:02:50.747000, msbulletin: [{bulletin_id: MS12-041, bulletin_url: None, date: 2012-06-12T00:00:00, impact: Elevation of Privilege, knowledgebase_id: 2709162, knowledgebase_url: None, severity: Important, title: Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege}], nessus: [{NASL family: Windows : Microsoft Bulletins, NASL id: SMB_NT_MS12-041.NASL, description: The remote Windows host is affected by several vulnerabilities in the Kernel-Mode drivers that could allow elevation of privilege :
