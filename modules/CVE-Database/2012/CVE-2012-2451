    The Perl Config-IniFiles module uses predicatable temporary file names.
  Impact :

    A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary       files with the privileges of the user running the application.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 61544, published: 2012-08-15, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=61544, title: GLSA-201208-05 : Perl Config-IniFiles Module: Insecure temporary file usage}, {NASL family: FreeBSD Local Security Checks, NASL id: FREEBSD_PKG_725AB25A987B11E1A2EF001FD0AF1A4C.NASL, description: Unsafe Temporary file creation
