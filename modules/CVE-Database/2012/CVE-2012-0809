Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters., summary: An attacker includes formatting characters in a string input field on the target application. Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An attacker can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the attacker can write to the program stack.}, {id: 67, name: String Format Overflow in syslog(), prerequisites: The format string argument of the Syslog function can be tainted with user supplied data., related_weakness: [120, 134, 74, 20, 680, 697], solutions: The following code shows a vulnerable usage of Syslog():, summary: This attack targets the format string vulnerabilities in the syslog() function.

    Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo:
      When the sudoers file is configured with a Runas group, sudo does not         prompt for a password when changing to the new group (CVE-2011-0010).
      A format string vulnerability exists in the 'sudo_debug()' function         (CVE-2012-0809).
  Impact :

    A local attacker could possibly gain the ability to run arbitrary       commands with the privileges of other users or groups, including root.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2016-09-13, plugin id: 58216, published: 2012-03-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=58216, title: GLSA-201203-06 : sudo: Privilege escalation}, {NASL family: FreeBSD Local Security Checks, NASL id: FREEBSD_PKG_7C920BB74B5F11E19F4700E0815B8DA8.NASL, description: Todd Miller reports :

Sudo 1.8.0 introduced simple debugging support that was primarily intended for use when developing policy or I/O logging plugins. The sudo_debug() function contains a flaw where the program name is used as part of the format string passed to the fprintf() function. The program name can be controlled by the caller, either via a symbolic link or, on some systems, by setting argv[0] when executing sudo.

Using standard format string vulnerability exploitation techniques it is possible to leverage this bug to achieve root privileges.

Exploitation of the bug does not require that the attacker be listed in the sudoers file. As such, we strongly suggest that affected sites upgrade from affected sudo versions as soon as possible., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-10, plugin id: 57739, published: 2012-01-31, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=57739, title: FreeBSD : sudo -- format string vulnerability (7c920bb7-4b5f-11e1-9f47-00e0815b8da8)}, {NASL family: SuSE Local Security Checks, NASL id: OPENSUSE-2012-73.NASL, description: sudo was prone to a format string vulnerability, last seen: 2018-09-01, modified: 2016-09-13, plugin id: 74791, published: 2014-06-13, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=74791, title: openSUSE Security Update : sudo (openSUSE-2012-73)}, {NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2012-1028.NASL, description: - fixed CVE-2012-0809
