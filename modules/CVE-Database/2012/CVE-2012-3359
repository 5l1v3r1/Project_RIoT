Updated conga packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section.

The Conga project is a management system for remote workstations. It consists of luci, which is a secure web-based front end, and ricci, which is a secure daemon that dispatches incoming messages to underlying management modules.

It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session cookies. This issue prevented the session inactivity timeout feature from working correctly, and allowed attackers able to get access to a session cookie to obtain the victim's authentication credentials.
(CVE-2012-3359)

Red Hat would like to thank George Hedfors of Cybercom Sweden East AB for reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the fence_apc_snmp agent to be configured. As a consequence, users could not configure or view an existing configuration for fence_apc_snmp. This update adds a new screen that allows fence_apc_snmp to be configured. (BZ#832181)

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the SSL operation of the fence_ilo fence agent to be enabled or disabled. As a consequence, users could not configure or view an existing configuration for the 'ssl' attribute for fence_ilo. This update adds a checkbox to show whether the SSL operation is enabled and allows users to edit that attribute. (BZ#832183)

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the 'identity_file' attribute of the fence_ilo_mp fence agent to be viewed or edited. As a consequence, users could not configure or view an existing configuration for the 'identity_file' attribute of the fence_ilo_mp fence agent. This update adds a text input box to show the current state of the 'identity_file' attribute of fence_ilo_mp and allows users to edit that attribute. (BZ#832185)

* Prior to this update, redundant files and directories remained on the file system at /var/lib/luci/var/pts and /usr/lib{,64}/luci/zope/var/pts when the luci package was uninstalled.
This update removes these files and directories when the luci package is uninstalled. (BZ#835649)

* Prior to this update, the 'restart-disable' recovery policy was not displayed in the recovery policy list from which users could select when they configure a recovery policy for a failover domain. As a consequence, the 'restart-disable' recovery policy could not be set with the luci GUI. This update adds the 'restart-disable' recovery option to the recovery policy pulldown list. (BZ#839732)

* Prior to this update, line breaks that were not anticipated in the 'yum list' output could cause package upgrade and/or installation to fail when creating clusters or adding nodes to existing clusters. As a consequence, creating clusters and adding cluster nodes to existing clusters could fail. This update modifies the ricci daemon to be able to correctly handle line breaks in the 'yum list' output. (BZ#842865)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements :

* This update adds support for configuring the Intel iPDU fence agent to the luci package. (BZ#741986)

* This update adds support for viewing and changing the state of the new 'nfsrestart' attribute to the FS and Cluster FS resource agent configuration screens. (BZ#822633)

All users of conga are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this update, the luci and ricci services will be restarted automatically., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-18, plugin id: 68699, published: 2013-07-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=68699, title: Oracle Linux 5 : conga (ELSA-2013-0128)}, {NASL family: Scientific Linux Local Security Checks, NASL id: SL_20130108_CONGA_ON_SL5_X.NASL, description: It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session cookies.

This update adds a checkbox to show     whether the SSL operation is enabled and allows users to     edit that attribute.

  - Prior to this update, luci did not allow the     'identity_file' attribute of the fence_ilo_mp fence     agent to be viewed or edited.
