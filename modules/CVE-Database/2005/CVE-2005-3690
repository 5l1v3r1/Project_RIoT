The IMAP server bundled with the version of MailEnable Professional or Enterprise Edition installed on the remote host is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow when handling an overly-long mailbox name in certain commands.  An authenticated attacker may be able to leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code remotely as the SYSTEM user. 

It also fails to filter directory traversal sequences from mailbox names passed to the 'CREATE' and 'RENAME' commands.  An authenticated attacker can exploit these issues to create arbitrary directories on the affected host and to cause a denial of service by renaming the mail directories of other users., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 20226, published: 2005-11-20, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=20226, title: MailEnable < 1.7 IMAP Server Multiple Vulnerabilities (ME-100008)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2005-11/0581.html, http://securitytracker.com/id?1015239, http://www.mailenable.com/hotfix/, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15492, http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2005/2484, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/23110], refmap: {bid: [15492], confirm: [http://www.mailenable.com/hotfix/], fulldisc: [20051118 Secunia Research: MailEnable Buffer Overflow and Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities], misc: [http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2005-59/advisory/], osvdb: [20929], sectrack: [1015239], secunia: [17633], vupen: [ADV-2005-2484], xf: [mailenable-imap-mailbox-bo(23110)]}, saint: [{bid: 15492, description: MailEnable IMAP mailbox name buffer overflow, id: mail_imap_mailenable,mail_imap_mailenableent, osvdb: 20929, title: mailenable_imap_mailbox, type: remote}], summary: Stack-based buffer overflow in the IMAP service (meimaps.exe) of MailEnable Professional 1.6 and earlier and Enterprise 1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long mailbox name in the (1) select, (2) create, (3) delete, (4) rename, (5) subscribe, or (6) unsubscribe commands., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable_enterprise:1.1, title: cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable_enterprise:1.1}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable_professional:1.6, title: cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable_professional:1.6}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:mailenable:mailenable_enterprise:1.1, cpe:/a:mailenable:mailenable_professional:1.6]}
