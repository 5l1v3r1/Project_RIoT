  o Denial of Service Vulnerabilities.
    A request for a file on floppy drive may result in a dialog     prompt, causing the service to cease until it is acknowledged by     an administrator. In addition, requesting the file 'Filelist.html'     reportedly causes CPU usage on the remote host to increase,     ultimately leading to denial of service.

  o Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities.
    A request for a nonexistent file will return an error message     with the installation path for the software. Further, error     messages differ depending on whether a file exists or is     inaccessible. An attacker may exploit these issues to gain     information about the filesystem on the remote host.

Note that while versions 4.3 and 5.5 are known to be affected, earlier versions are likely to be as well., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 17320, published: 2005-03-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=17320, title: Active WebCam Webserver <= 5.5 Multiple Vulnerabilities (DoS, Path Disc)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2005-03/0216.html, http://secway.org/advisory/ad20050104.txt, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/19647], refmap: {fulldisc: [20050310 Multiple Vulnerabilities of PY Software Active Webcam WebServer], misc: [http://secway.org/advisory/ad20050104.txt], secunia: [14553], xf: [active-webcam-dos(19647)]}, summary: PY Software Active Webcam WebServer (webcam.exe) 5.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a request to a file on the floppy drive, as demonstrated using A:\a.txt., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:py_software:active_webcam:5.5, title: cpe:2.3:a:py_software:active_webcam:5.5}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:py_software:active_webcam:5.5]}
