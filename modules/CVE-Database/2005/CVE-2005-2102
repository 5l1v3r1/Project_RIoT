Invalid characters in a sent file can cause Gaim to crash on some systems (CVE-2005-2102); a remote AIM or ICQ user can cause a buffer overflow in Gaim by setting an away message containing many AIM substitution strings (CVE-2005-2103); a memory alignment bug in the library used by Gaim to access the Gadu-Gadu network can result in a buffer overflow on non-x86 architecture systems (CVE-2005-2370).

These problems have been corrected in gaim 1.5.0 which is provided with this update., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-19, plugin id: 19896, published: 2005-10-05, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=19896, title: Mandrake Linux Security Advisory : gaim (MDKSA-2005:139)}, {NASL family: Gentoo Local Security Checks, NASL id: GENTOO_GLSA-200508-06.NASL, description: The remote host is affected by the vulnerability described in GLSA-200508-06 (Gaim: Remote execution of arbitrary code)

    Brandon Perry discovered that Gaim is vulnerable to a heap-based     buffer overflow when handling away messages (CAN-2005-2103).
    Furthermore, Daniel Atallah discovered a vulnerability in the handling     of file transfers (CAN-2005-2102).
  Impact :

    A remote attacker could create a specially crafted away message     which, when viewed by the target user, could lead to the execution of     arbitrary code. Also, an attacker could send a file with a non-UTF8     filename to a user, which would result in a Denial of Service.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 19439, published: 2005-08-18, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=19439, title: GLSA-200508-06 : Gaim: Remote execution of arbitrary code}, {NASL family: Slackware Local Security Checks, NASL id: SLACKWARE_SSA_2005-242-03.NASL, description: New gaim packages are available for Slackware 9.0, 9.1, 10.0, 10.1, and -current to fix some security issues. including: AIM/ICQ away message buffer overflow AIM/ICQ non-UTF-8 filename crash Gadu-Gadu memory alignment bug Sites that use GAIM should upgrade to the new version., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-08-09, plugin id: 19860, published: 2005-10-05, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=19860, title: Slackware 10.0 / 10.1 / 9.0 / 9.1 / current : gaim (SSA:2005-242-03)}, {NASL family: CentOS Local Security Checks, NASL id: CENTOS_RHSA-2005-627.NASL, description: An updated gaim package that fixes multiple security issues is now available.

Gaim is an Internet Messaging client.

A heap based buffer overflow issue was discovered in the way Gaim processes away messages. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted away message to a Gaim user logged into AIM or ICQ that could result in arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-2103 to this issue.

Daniel Atallah discovered a denial of service issue in Gaim. A remote attacker could attempt to upload a file with a specially crafted name to a user logged into AIM or ICQ, causing Gaim to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-2102 to this issue.

A denial of service bug was found in Gaim's Gadu Gadu protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted message to a Gaim user logged into Gadu Gadu, causing Gaim to crash. Please note that this issue only affects PPC and IBM S/390 systems running Gaim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-2370 to this issue.

Users of gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-10, plugin id: 21846, published: 2006-07-03, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=21846, title: CentOS 3 / 4 : gaim (CESA-2005:627)}, {NASL family: Ubuntu Local Security Checks, NASL id: UBUNTU_USN-168-1.NASL, description: Daniel Atallah discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the file transfer handler of OSCAR (the module that handles various instant messaging protocols like ICQ). A remote attacker could crash the Gaim client of an user by attempting to send him a file with a name that contains invalid UTF-8 characters. (CAN-2005-2102)

It was found that specially crafted 'away' messages triggered a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the Gaim client or possibly even execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the Gaim user. (CAN-2005-2103)

Szymon Zygmunt and Michal Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment error in the Gadu library, which was fixed in USN-162-1.
However, it was discovered that Gaim contains a copy of the vulnerable code. By sending specially crafted messages over the Gadu protocol, a remote attacker could crash Gaim. (CAN-2005-2370).
