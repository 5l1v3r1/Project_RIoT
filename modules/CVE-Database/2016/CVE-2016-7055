  - A flaw exists in the mod_session_crypto module due to     encryption for data and cookies using the configured     ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of     operation (AES256-CBC by default). An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this, via a padding oracle     attack, to decrypt information without knowledge of the     encryption key, resulting in the disclosure of     potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2016-0736)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     mod_auth_digest module during client entry allocation.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via specially crafted input, to exhaust shared memory     resources, resulting in a server crash. (CVE-2016-2161)

  - The Apache HTTP Server is affected by a     man-in-the-middle vulnerability known as 'httpoxy' due     to a failure to properly resolve namespace conflicts in     accordance with RFC 3875 section 4.1.18. The HTTP_PROXY     environment variable is set based on untrusted user data     in the 'Proxy' header of HTTP requests. The HTTP_PROXY     environment variable is used by some web client     libraries to specify a remote proxy server. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted 'Proxy' header in an HTTP request, to redirect     an application's internal HTTP traffic to an arbitrary     proxy server where it may be observed or manipulated.
    (CVE-2016-5387, CVE-2016-1000102, CVE-2016-1000104)

  - A carry propagation error exists in the     Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure     when handling input lengths divisible by but longer than     256 bits. This can result in transient authentication     and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous     outcomes of public-key operations with specially crafted     input. A man-in-the-middle attacker can possibly exploit     this issue to compromise ECDH key negotiations that     utilize Brainpool P-512 curves. (CVE-2016-7055)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     mod_http2 module due to improper handling of the     LimitRequestFields directive. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via specially crafted     CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request, to inject     unlimited request headers into the server, resulting in     the exhaustion of memory resources. (CVE-2016-8740)

  - A flaw exists due to improper handling of whitespace     patterns in user-agent headers. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this, via a specially     crafted user-agent header, to cause the program to     incorrectly process sequences of requests, resulting in     interpreting responses incorrectly, polluting the cache,     or disclosing the content from one request to a second     downstream user-agent. (CVE-2016-8743)

  - A flaw exits in libcurl in the randit() function within     file lib/rand.c due to improper initialization of the     32-bit random value, which is used, for example, to     generate Digest and NTLM authentication nonces,     resulting in weaker cryptographic operations than     expected. (CVE-2016-9594)

  - A floating pointer exception flaw exists in the     exif_convert_any_to_int() function in exif.c that is     triggered when handling TIFF and JPEG image tags. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service     condition. (CVE-2016-10158)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     phar_parse_pharfile() function in phar.c due to improper     validation when handling phar archives. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service     condition. (CVE-2016-10159)

  - An off-by-one overflow condition exists in the     phar_parse_pharfile() function in phar.c due to improper     parsing of phar archives. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a crash, resulting in     a denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-10160)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the     finish_nested_data() function in var_unserializer.c due     to improper validation of unserialized data. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service     condition or the disclosure of memory contents.
    (CVE-2016-10161)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx() function within file gd_gd2.c     in the GD Graphics Library (LibGD) when handling images     claiming to contain more image data than they actually     do. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this     to crash a process linked against the library.
    (CVE-2016-10167)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists when handling packets     using the CHACHA20/POLY1305 or RC4-MD5 ciphers. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via     specially crafted truncated packets, to cause a denial     of service condition. (CVE-2017-3731)

  - A carry propagating error exists in the x86_64     Montgomery squaring implementation that may cause the     BN_mod_exp() function to produce incorrect results. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker with sufficient     resources can exploit this to obtain sensitive     information regarding private keys. Note that this issue     is very similar to CVE-2015-3193. Moreover, the attacker     would additionally need online access to an unpatched     system using the target private key in a scenario with     persistent DH parameters and a private key that is     shared between multiple clients. For example, this can     occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS cipher     suites. (CVE-2017-3732)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the     phar_parse_pharfile() function in phar.c due to improper     parsing of phar archives. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a crash, resulting in     a denial of service condition.

  - Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS)     vulnerabilities exist in unspecified scripts due to a     failure to validate input before returning it to users.
    An authenticated, remote authenticated attacker can     exploit these, via a specially crafted request, to     execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser     session.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - A NULL pointer deference flaw exists, specifically in     the asn1_item_embed_d2i() function within file     crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c, when handling the ASN.1 CHOICE     type, which results in a NULL value being passed to the     structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain     invalid encodings. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-7053)

  - A heap overflow condition exists in the     chacha20_poly1305_cipher() function within file     crypto/evp/e_chacha20_poly1305.c when handling TLS     connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher suites. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-7054)

  - A carry propagation error exists in the     Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure     when handling input lengths divisible by but longer than     256 bits. This can result in transient authentication     and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous     outcomes of public-key operations with specially crafted     input. A man-in-the-middle attacker can possibly exploit     this issue to compromise ECDH key negotiations that     utilize Brainpool P-512 curves. (CVE-2016-7055)

  - An unspecified flaw exists that allows an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary     code. (CVE-2017-5815)

  - A command injection vulnerability exists in the dbman     service due to improper validation of user-supplied     input before it is passed to a system call. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted opcode 10008 request, to inject and     execute arbitrary OS commands with SYSTEM privileges.
    (CVE-2017-5816)

  - Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist in the     dbman service due to improper validation of     user-supplied input before it is passed to a system     call. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     these, via a specially crafted opcode 10007 request, to     inject and execute arbitrary OS commands with SYSTEM     privileges. (CVE-2017-5817, CVE-2017-5819)

  - A flaw exists in the dbman service when handling opcode     10007 requests due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a specially crafted request, to     delete arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges.
    (CVE-2017-5818)

  - A flaw exists in the dbman service when handling opcode     10004 requests due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a specially crafted request, to     execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5820)

  - A flaw exists in the dbman service when handling opcode     10006 and 10010 requests due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a specially request, to execute     arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5821)

  - A flaw exists in the dbman service when handling opcode     10010 requests due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a specially crafted request, to     execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5822)

  - A flaw exists in the dbman service when handling opcode     10013 requests due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a specially crafted request, to     execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5823)

  - An unspecified remote code execution vulnerability     exists that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker     to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-8948)

  - A stack-based buffer overflow condition exists due to     improper validation of input when copying data. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service condition or the execution of     arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-8956)

Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected., the hacker news: [{id: THN:82BC3700070E6531BDA9B4A8023496B6, last seen: 2018-01-27, modified: 2016-11-10, published: 2016-11-10, reporter: Mohit Kumar, source: https://thehackernews.com/2016/11/openssl-patch-update.html, title: OpenSSL Releases Patch For "High" Severity Vulnerability}], vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2, title: OpenSSL Project OpenSSL 1.0.2}, {id: cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.0b, title: OpenSSL Project OpenSSL 1.1.0b}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2, cpe:/a:openssl:openssl:1.1.0b]}
