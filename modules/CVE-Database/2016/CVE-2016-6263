First, the targeted software must be written in a language that enables fine grained buffer control.

Finally, the adversary must have the capability to influence the input that guides these buffer operations., related_weakness: [125], solutions: , summary: An adversary attacks a target by providing input that causes an application to read beyond the boundary of a defined buffer. This typically occurs when a value influencing where to start or stop reading is set to reflect positions outside of the valid memory location of the buffer. This type of attack may result in exposure of sensitive information, a system crash, or arbitrary code execution.}], cvss: 5.0, cvss-time: 2016-09-08T10:19:36.307000, cwe: CWE-125, id: CVE-2016-6263, impact: {availability: PARTIAL, confidentiality: NONE, integrity: NONE}, nessus: [{NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2016-610FE5F5F8.NASL, description: Security fix for CVE-2016-6263, CVE-2015-8948, CVE-2016-6262, CVE-2016-6261

CVE-2015-8948

When idn is reading one zero byte as input an out-of-bounds-read occurred.

CVE-2016-6261

An out-of-bounds stack read is exploitable in idna_to_ascii_4i.

CVE-2016-6263

stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize reject invalid UTF-8, causes a crash.

For Debian 7 'Wheezy', these problems have been fixed in version 1.25-2+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libidn packages.
