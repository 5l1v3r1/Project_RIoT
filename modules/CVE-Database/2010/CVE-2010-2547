    The GPGSM utility in GnuPG contains a use-after-free vulnerability that       may be exploited when importing a crafted X.509 certificate explicitly or       during the signature verification process.
  Impact :

    An unauthenticated remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the       privileges of the user running GnuPG by enticing them to import a crafted       certificate.

Importing a certificate with more than 98 Subject Alternate Names via GPGSM's import command or implicitly while verifying a signature causes GPGSM to reallocate an array with the names. The bug is that the reallocation code misses assigning the reallocated array to the old array variable and thus the old and freed array will be used.
Usually this leads to a segv (CVE-2010-2547).
