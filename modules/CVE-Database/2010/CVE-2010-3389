It was discovered that certain resource agent scripts set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value containing empty path elements.

(CVE-2010-3389)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

  - The failover domain 'nofailback' option was not honored     if a service was in the 'starting' state. This bug has     been fixed.

  - PID files with white spaces in the file name are now     handled correctly.

  - The /usr/sbin/rhev-check.sh script can now be used from     within Cron.

  - The clustat utility now reports the correct version.

  - The oracledb.sh agent now attempts to try the 'shutdown     immediate' command instead of using the 'shutdown abort'     command.

  - The SAPInstance and SAPDatabase scripts now use proper     directory name quoting so they no longer collide with     directory names like '/u'.

  - The clufindhostname utility now returns the correct     value in all cases.

  - The nfsclient resource agent now handles paths with     trailing slashes correctly.

  - The last owner of a service is now reported correctly     after a failover.

  - The /usr/share/cluster/fs.sh script no longer runs the     'quotaoff' command if quotas were not configured.

  - The 'listen' line in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file     generated by the Apache resource agent is now correct.

  - The tomcat-5 resource agent no longer generates     incorrect configurations.

  - The time required to stop an NFS resource when the     server is unavailable has been reduced.

  - When using exclusive prioritization, a higher priority     service now preempts a lower priority service after     status check failures.

  - The postgres-8 resource agent now correctly detects     failed start operations.

  - The handling of reference counts passed by rgmanager to     resource agents now works properly, as expected.

As well, this update adds the following enhancements :

  - It is now possible to disable updates to static routes     by the IP resource agent.

  - It is now possible to use XFS as a file system within a     cluster service.

  - It is now possible to use the 'clustat' command as a     non-root user, so long as that user is in the 'root'     group.

  - It is now possible to migrate virtual machines when     central processing is enabled.

  - The rgmanager init script will now delay after stopping     services in order to allow time for other nodes to     restart them.

  - The handling of failed independent subtrees has been     corrected.

It was discovered that certain resource agent scripts set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value containing empty path elements. A local user able to trick a user running those scripts to run them while working from an attacker-writable directory could use this flaw to escalate their privileges via a specially crafted dynamic library. (CVE-2010-3389)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

  - When using the Sybase database and the ASEHAagent     resource in the cluster.conf file, it was not possible     to run more than one ASEHAagent per Sybase installation.
    Consequently, a second ASEHA (Sybase Adaptive Server     Enterprise (ASE) with the High Availability Option)     agent could not be run. This bug has been fixed and it     is now possible to use two ASEHA agents using the same     Sybase installation.

  - The s/lang scripts, which implement internal     functionality for the rgmanager package, while the     central_processing option is in use, were included in     the wrong package. Now, the rgmanager and     resource-agents packages require each other for     installation to prevent problems when they are used     separately.

  - Previously, the oracledb.sh script was using the     'shutdown abort' command as the first attempt to shut     down a database. With this update, oracledb.sh first     attempts a graceful shutdown via the 'shutdown     immediate' command before forcing the shutdown.

  - Previously, when setting up a service on a cluster with     a shared IP resource and an Apache resource, the     generated httpd.conf file contained a bug in the line     describing the shared IP address (the 'Listen' line).
    Now, the Apache resource agent generates the 'Listen'     line properly.

  - If a high-availability (HA) cluster service was defined     with an Apache resource and was named with two words,     such as 'kickstart httpd', the service never started     because it could not find a directory with the space     character in its name escaped. Now, Apache resources     work properly if a name contains a space as described     above.

  - When inheritance was used in the cluster.conf file, a     bug in the /usr/share/cluster/nfsclient.sh file     prevented it from monitoring NFS exports properly.
    Consequently, monitoring of NFS exports to NFS clients     resulted in an endless loop. This bug has been fixed and     the monitoring now works as expected.

  - Previously, the postgres-8 resource agent did not detect     when a PostgreSQL server failed to start. This bug has     been fixed and postgres-8 now works as expected in the     described scenario.

  - When using the Pacemaker resource manager, the fs.sh     resource agent reported an error condition, if called     with the 'monitor' parameter and the referenced device     did not exist. Consequently, the error condition     prevented the resource from being started. Now, fs.sh     returns the proper response code in the described     scenario, thus fixing this bug.

  - Previously, numerous RGManager resource agents returned     incorrect response codes when coupled with the Pacemaker     resource manager. Now, the agents have been updated to     work with Pacemaker properly.

This update also adds the following enhancement :

  - With this update, when the network is removed from a     node using the netfs.sh resource agent, it now recovers     faster than previously.

As well, this update upgrades the resource-agents package to upstream version 3.9.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.

This update also fixes the following bugs :

  - Previously, starting threads could incorrectly include a     reference to an exited thread if that thread exited when     rgmanager received a request to start a new thread. Due     to this issue, the new thread did not retry and entered     an infinite loop. This update ensures that new threads     do not reference old threads. Now, new threads no longer     enter an infinite loop in which the rgmanager enables     and disables services without failing gracefully.
    (BZ#502872)

  - Previously, nfsclient.sh left temporary     nfsclient-status-cache-25217 files in /tmp/. (BZ#506152)

  - Previously, the function local_node_name in     /resources/utils/member_util.sh did not correctly check     whether magma_tool failed. Due to this issue, empty     strings could be returned. This update checks the input     and rejects empty strings. (BZ#516758)

  - Previously, the file system agent could kill a process     when an application used a mount point with a similar     name to a mount point managed by rgmanager using     force_unmount. With this update, the file system agent     kills only the processes that access the mount point     managed by rgmanager. (BZ#555901)

  - Previously, simultaneous execution of 'lvchange
    --deltag' from /etc/init.d/rgmanager caused a checksum     error on High Availability Logical Volume Manager     (HA-LVM). With this update, ownership of LVM tags is     checked before removing them. (BZ#559582)

  - Previously, the isAlive check could fail if two nodes     used the same file name. With this update, the isAlive     function prevents two nodes from using the same file     name. (BZ#469815)

  - Previously, the S/Lang code could lead to unwanted     S/Lang stack leaks during event processing.
