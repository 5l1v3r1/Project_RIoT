This plugin does not attempt to exploit the vulnerability and only runs when 'Check for PCI-DSS compliance' is enabled in the scan policy.  This plugin reports all web servers using ASP.NET 1.1.  If it cannot determine the version, it will report all web servers using ASP.NET. Manual verification is required to determine if a vulnerability is present., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 64589, published: 2013-02-13, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=64589, title: Microsoft ASP.NET MS-DOS Device Name DoS (PCI-DSS check)}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2007-05/0419.html, http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/May/0378.html, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/34418], refmap: {fulldisc: [20070522 Question Regarding IIS 6.0 / Is this a DoS???, 20070523 Re: Question Regarding IIS 6.0 / Is this a DoS???], xf: [iis-auxaspx-dos(34418)]}, summary: Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server instability or device hang), and possibly obtain sensitive information (device communication traffic); and might allow attackers with physical access to execute arbitrary code after connecting a data stream to a device COM port; via requests for a URI containing a '/' immediately before and after the name of a DOS device, as demonstrated by the /AUX/.aspx URI, which bypasses a blacklist for DOS device requests., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_information_server:6.0, title: Microsoft IIS 6.0}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:microsoft:internet_information_server:6.0]}
