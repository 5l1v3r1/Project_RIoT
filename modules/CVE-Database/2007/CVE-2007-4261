The version of EZPhotoSales installed on the remote host fails to restrict access to configuration files used by the application.  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can leverage this issue to obtain sensitive information about the affected application, possibly enabling him to gain administrative control, which in turn could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected host, cross-site scripting attacks against visitors, and the like., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-11-15, plugin id: 25899, published: 2007-08-16, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=25899, title: EZPhotoSales Multiple Configuration Files Remote Information Disclosure}], ranking: [[{circl: 3}]], references: [http://securityreason.com/securityalert/2985, http://www.airscanner.com/security/07080601_ezphotosales.htm, http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=267, http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=268, http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/475678/100/0/threaded, http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/25323, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/35840, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/35841], refmap: {bid: [25323], bugtraq: [20070806 EZPhotoSales 1.9.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities], misc: [http://www.airscanner.com/security/07080601_ezphotosales.htm, http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=267, http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=268], secunia: [26341], sreason: [2985], xf: [ezphotosales-config-information-disclosure(35841), ezphotosales-galleries-info-disclosure(35840)]}, summary: EZPhotoSales 1.9.3 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download (1) a file containing cleartext passwords via a direct request for OnlineViewing/data/galleries.txt, or (2) a file containing username hashes and password hashes via a direct request for OnlineViewing/configuration/config.dat/.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged for administrative access because authentication does not require knowledge of cleartext values, but instead uses the username hash in the ConfigLogin parameter and the password hash in the ConfigPassword parameter., vulnerable_configuration: [{id: cpe:2.3:a:ez_photo_sales:ez_photo_sales:1.9.3, title: cpe:2.3:a:ez_photo_sales:ez_photo_sales:1.9.3}], vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2: [cpe:/a:ez_photo_sales:ez_photo_sales:1.9.3]}
