  - As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.2 and 1.5.0.10 update     releases several bugs were fixed to improve the     stability of the browser. Some of these were crashes     that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume     that with enough effort at least some of these could be     exploited to run arbitrary code. These fixes affected     the layout engine (CVE-2007-0775), SVG renderer     (CVE-2007-0776) and JavaScript engine. (CVE-2007-0777).
    (MFSA 2007-01)

  - Various enhancements were done to make XSS exploits     against websites less effective. These included fixes     for invalid trailing characters (CVE-2007-0995), child     frame character set inheritance (CVE-2007-0996),     password form injection (CVE-2006-6077), and the Adobe     Reader universal XSS problem. (MFSA 2007-02)

  - AAd reported a potential disk cache collision that could     be exploited by remote attackers to steal confidential     data or execute code. (MFSA 2007-03 / CVE-2007-0778)

  - David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as     the host name and security indicators--could be spoofed     by using a large, mostly transparent, custom cursor and     adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property so that the visible     part of the cursor floated outside the browser content     area. (MFSA 2007-04 / CVE-2007-0779)

  - Manually opening blocked popups could be exploited by     remote attackers to allow XSS attacks (CVE-2007-0780) or     to execute code in local files. (CVE-2007-0800). (MFSA     2007-05)

  - Two buffer overflows were found in the NSS handling of     Mozilla. (MFSA 2007-06)

  - SSL clients such as Firefox and Thunderbird can suffer a     buffer overflow if a malicious server presents a     certificate with a public key that is too small to     encrypt the entire 'Master Secret'. Exploiting this     overflow appears to be unreliable but possible if the     SSLv2 protocol is enabled. (CVE-2007-0008)

  - Servers that use NSS for the SSLv2 protocol can be     exploited by a client that presents a 'Client Master     Key' with invalid length values in any of several fields     that are used without adequate error checking. This can     lead to a buffer overflow that presumably could be     exploitable. (CVE-2007-0009)

  - Michal Zalewski demonstrated that setting     location.hostname to a value with embedded null     characters can confuse the browsers domain checks.
    Setting the value triggers a load, but the networking     software reads the hostname only up to the null     character while other checks for 'parent domain' start     at the right and so can have a completely different idea     of what the current host is.

[Updated 06 March 2007] Updated text description to add CVE-2007-1282 and remove CVE-2007-0994, which was mistakenly listed as affecting Thunderbird. No changes have been made to these erratum packages.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed JavaScript code. A malicious HTML mail message could execute JavaScript code in such a way that may result in Thunderbird crashing or executing arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; these issues are not exploitable unless the user has enabled JavaScript.
(CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777, CVE-2007-1092)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed text/enhanced and text/richtext formatted mail message. A specially crafted mail message could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2007-1282)

Several cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed HTML mail messages. A malicious HTML mail message could display misleading information which may result in a user unknowingly divulging sensitive information such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995, CVE-2007-0996)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird cached web content on the local disk. A malicious HTML mail message may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird displayed certain web content.
A malicious HTML mail message could generate content which could overlay user interface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a user into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)

Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed blocked popup windows. If a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read arbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user. (CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)

Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS) code for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure web server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the 'location.hostname' value during certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious HTML mail message to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an XSS attack.
(CVE-2007-0981)

    Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG     stroke widths that affects Mozilla Firefox 2 only. Various researchers     reported some errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to     memory corruption. Mozilla Firefox also contains minor vulnerabilities     involving cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or     CSS rendering under certain conditions.
  Impact :

    An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page     that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the     execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to     spoof the address bar, steal information through cache collision,     bypass the local files protection mechanism with pop-ups, or perform     cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive     information, like user credentials.
  Workaround :

    There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but     most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 24771, published: 2007-03-06, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=24771, title: GLSA-200703-04 : Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: Fedora Local Security Checks, NASL id: FEDORA_2007-281.NASL, description: - Thu Feb 22 2007 Martin Stransky <stransky at redhat.com>

    There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but     most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the     execution of JavaScript is disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email     client, and enabling it is strongly discouraged., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-11, plugin id: 24800, published: 2007-03-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=24800, title: GLSA-200703-08 : SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities}, {NASL family: SuSE Local Security Checks, NASL id: SUSE_MOZILLAFIREFOX-2699.NASL, description: This update brings Mozilla Firefox to security update version 1.5.0.10.

  - MFSA 2007-01: As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.2 and     1.5.0.10 update releases several bugs were fixed to     improve the stability of the browser. Some of these were     crashes that showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort at least some of these     could be exploited to run arbitrary code. These fixes     affected the layout engine (CVE-2007-0775), SVG renderer     (CVE-2007-0776) and JavaScript engine (CVE-2007-0777).

  - MFSA 2007-02: Various enhancements were done to make XSS     exploits against websites less effective. These included     fixes for invalid trailing characters (CVE-2007-0995),     child frame character set inheritance (CVE-2007-0996),     password form injection (CVE-2006-6077), and the Adobe     Reader universal XSS problem.

  - MFSA 2007-03/CVE-2007-0778: AAd reported a potential     disk cache collision that could be exploited by remote     attackers to steal confidential data or execute code.

  - MFSA 2007-04/CVE-2007-0779: David Eckel reported that     browser UI elements--such as the host name and security     indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly     transparent, custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3     hotspot property so that the visible part of the cursor     floated outside the browser content area.

  - MFSA 2007-05: Manually opening blocked popups could be     exploited by remote attackers to allow XSS attacks     (CVE-2007-0780) or to execute code in local files     (CVE-2007-0800).

  - MFSA 2007-06: Two buffer overflows were found in the NSS     handling of Mozilla.

    CVE-2007-0008: SSL clients such as Firefox and     Thunderbird can suffer a buffer overflow if a malicious     server presents a certificate with a public key that is     too small to encrypt the entire 'Master Secret'.
    Exploiting this overflow appears to be unreliable but     possible if the SSLv2 protocol is enabled.

    CVE-2007-0009: Servers that use NSS for the SSLv2     protocol can be exploited by a client that presents a     'Client Master Key' with invalid length values in any of     several fields that are used without adequate error     checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow that     presumably could be exploitable.

  - MFSA 2007-06/CVE-2007-0981: Michal Zalewski demonstrated     that setting location.hostname to a value with embedded     null characters can confuse the browsers domain checks.
    Setting the value triggers a load, but the networking     software reads the hostname only up to the null     character while other checks for 'parent domain' start     at the right and so can have a completely different idea     of what the current host is., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-07-19, plugin id: 27119, published: 2007-10-17, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=27119, title: openSUSE 10 Security Update : MozillaFirefox (MozillaFirefox-2699)}, {NASL family: Slackware Local Security Checks, NASL id: SLACKWARE_SSA_2007-066-03.NASL, description: New mozilla-firefox packages are available for Slackware 10.2, and 11.0 to fix security issues., last seen: 2019-02-21, modified: 2018-06-27, plugin id: 24789, published: 2007-03-12, reporter: Tenable, source: https://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=24789, title: Slackware 10.2 / 11.0 : mozilla-firefox (SSA:2007-066-03)}, {NASL family: Red Hat Local Security Checks, NASL id: REDHAT-RHSA-2007-0097.NASL, description: Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
